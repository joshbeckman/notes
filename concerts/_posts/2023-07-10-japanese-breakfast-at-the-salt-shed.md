Last minute, we decided to buy some cheap resale tickets for the **Japanese Breakfast** show at The Salt Shed down the street. We'd seen her perform a couple years ago at Thalia Hall (and thoroughly enjoyed her enthusiasm), so I knew it would be good a second time.

That first show was notable for her appreciation of the crowd, an appreciation of people enjoying _her_ music and _her_ stories. This show was all about her leaning into her songs, letting them resonate and fold back on top of the melodies, ripping solos on her guitar with infinite reverb.

I'm really loving these shows at The Salt Shed. Great big venue, fast lines, easily walkable.
