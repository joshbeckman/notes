With Emily and Bill and Kylie and Shannon and Brian and his new girlfriend Alex\. 
The show was fantastic\. Wreckno was the opener (and Bussy before that) and they did a great set as well\. 

Zed had a lot of old mid\-century music and videos mixed in with his songs and it all worked so well together\. It reminded me of the old Bassnectar shows like Ribbit and when he played MLKâ€™s I Have a Dream speech\. Playing a set with a cohesive message behind it and thought put into it as a whole work is just so much better\.
