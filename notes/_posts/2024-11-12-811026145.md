> In some sense both of these observations are saying different versions of the same thing: TikTok (and YouTube, and Instagram, etc.) [construct their users as speculators](https://maxread.substack.com/p/web3-as-a-speculative-community)--independent, atomized, founder-entrepreneurs, open to the market and eager for chaos and risk, from which they might profit. A person whose orientation toward the world has been shaped by the social-media feed might imagine themselves as a daring, nervy gambler, riding big swings in odds and sentiment to reap financial (and social) rewards. You can see how supporting Trump, both as a voter and as a futures market gambler-speculator, might fit easily into this narrative.

Not that many gamblers (or speculators) actually profit--but the casino always does. The house always wins. 

The basing together or people, the investment in each other instead of against each other in the houseâ€™s market, is the way out of this pit of competition.
