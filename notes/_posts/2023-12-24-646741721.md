> An honest but ungenerous response is that I don’t want to contribute my labor to the cause of helping Meta wring more ~value from its users—many of whom have no meaningful alternatives—*because those users are also human beings just like me* and they deserve better networks just as much as I do.

> A better response is that when we sit down to figure out what we want from our server administrators and what we’re going to do as individuals, it’s useful to acknowledge externalities as well as direct effects on “our” networks, because ignoring externalities (aka “other people somewhere else”) is precisely how we got the worst parts of our current moment.

Due to the network effects of social media/networks, there are side-effects beyond yourself from you contributing to one social platform or another.
