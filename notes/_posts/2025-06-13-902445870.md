> A useful way of thinking about persuasive techniques is how Scott Alexander frames them as either [asymmetric or symmetric](https://web.archive.org/web/20210531113605/https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/). An asymmetric weapon is only helpful if your point is correct – you will get frustrated quickly if you try to use the scientific method to prove that the earth is flat. However, speaking in a clear voice and being very handsome are symmetric. You don’t have to make a lick of sense to benefit from them. Narratives are symmetric.

If you want to be good, force yourself to use asymmetric techniques for persuasion. If you want to be fast/emotional, use the symmetric ones.
