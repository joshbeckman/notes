> On a 32 bit machine, a long is 4 bytes, and it's still going to be 4 bytes even after glibc does their "time_t is now 64 bits" thing that's coming down the pipe eventually. longs aren't going to change.

> So, when does this break? It turns out... 12 hours BEFORE everything else blows up. "DAY" is defined in the source as (24L * 3600L), so 86400 - the number of seconds in a day. It's taking half of that (so 43200 - 12 hours worth of seconds) and is adding it to the value it gets back from get_date. That makes it blow up 12 hours early.

> 2038-01-18 15:14:08Z is when that code will start returning negative numbers. That'll be fun and interesting.
> 
> Remember, the actual "end times" for signed 32 bit time_t is 12 hours later: 2038-01-19 03:14:08Z.

> The lesson here is: if you take a time and do math on it and shove it into another data type, you'd better make sure it won't overflow one of those types that *won't* be extended between now and then.
