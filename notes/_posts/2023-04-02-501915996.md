> variant of Lamport Clock, hereafter referred to as Lamport Origin [Clock](https://www.exhypothesi.com/clocks-and-causality/#naming), can produce a timestamp that is a doublet consisting of [node id, Lamport timestamp]. Lamport origin timestamp can be used to arrange events after the fact in a predictable order using originating node id as the second sort property. This removes the first deficiency of Lamport clocks discussed above, but it does not remove the other deficiencies of not knowing the order in real-time even for non-concurrent events.
