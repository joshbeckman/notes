> Despite the declining murder rate, there are less beat cops on the streets of Baltimore than ever. For the most part, they've been replaced by a cohort of city employed, formerly incarcerated men and women from the hoods of Baltimore who compose a violence intervention team called the Safe Streets Group, who have several offices around town and a 247 tip hotline where if you're from Baltimore, you can call in when you feel that a situation is escalating, but you don't want to call the cops.

What a shiining example of what de-escalation and policing alternatives (community groups) can do to prevent crime. Halved the murder rate in Baltimore, providing examples to young kids to prevent backsliding.

They also have a practice of going to the hospital with a victim after a violent encounter to continue targeted de-escalation right there; it's incredibly effective.

Notably, only ~12% of the violence is directly gang-related. The vast majority is just simple interpersonal arguments and domestic/romantic conflicts. (It's worth watching [the full interview with Mayor Brandon Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtJ8Y5RFz1c) for more details.)

Also notable that the major news outlets are still painting this program as a bad thing just because they see fewer cops on the streets.
