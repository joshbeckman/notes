> My favorite exercise we called the "Isolation Challenge," to stay fixed in one spot for one hour shooting one roll of film. Allowing subjects to come into our frame, to cast a shadow, or to contrast with our pre-aligned backgrounds, as opposed to chasing after something already happening. Most of us are walking around too much, constantly seeking to improve our position.

Cool exercise to notice more already in your frame.
