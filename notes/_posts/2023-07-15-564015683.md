> In his paper [The Theory of Graceful Extensibility: Basic rules that govern adaptive systems](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327427067_The_Theory_of_Graceful_Extensibility_Basic_rules_that_govern_adaptive_systems), David Woods borrows the term ***reciprocity*** from Elinor Ostrom to describe this property in a system of one agent being willing to lend resources to another as a necessary ingredient for resilience (emphasis mine):
> 
> > Will the neighboring units adapt in ways that extend the [capacity for maneuver] of the adaptive unit at risk? Or will the neighboring units behave in ways that further constrict the [capacity for maneuver] of the adaptive unit at risk? Ostrom (2003) has shown that **reciprocity is an essential property of networks of adaptive units that produce sustained adaptability**.

If you can, consider designing the system such that components can share resources reciprocally.
