> Strategy can only be employed top-down, so it’s not a question of top-down versus bottoms-up. Instead it’s a question of whether to have strategy at all. Outside of small, slow-growing organizations that can use social pressure to enforce strategy, only top-down leadership (or groups wielding that delegated authority) are capable of enforcing a practice, which is necessary for an effective strategy.
