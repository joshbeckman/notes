> The **imperial boomerang** is the thesis that governments that develop [repressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_repression) techniques to control [colonial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism) territories will eventually deploy those same techniques domestically against their own citizens. This concept originates with [Aimé Césaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aim%C3%A9_C%C3%A9saire) in *[Discourse on Colonialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_on_Colonialism)* (1950) where it is called the **terrific boomerang** to explain the origins of [European fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_fascism) in the first half of the 20th century.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_boomerang?utm_source=perfectsentences&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=perfect-sentences-130#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_boomerang?utm_source=perfectsentences&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=perfect-sentences-130#cite_note-Cesaire2000_p36-2) [Hannah Arendt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Arendt) agreed with this usage, calling it the **boomerang effect** in *[The Origins of Totalitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origins_of_Totalitarianism)* (1951).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_boomerang?utm_source=perfectsentences&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=perfect-sentences-130#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_boomerang?utm_source=perfectsentences&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=perfect-sentences-130#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_boomerang?utm_source=perfectsentences&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=perfect-sentences-130#cite_note-5) According to both writers, the methods of [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler) and the [Nazi Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party) were not exceptional from a world-wide view because European [colonial empires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_empire) had been killing millions of people worldwide as part of the process of [colonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization) for a very long time. Rather, they were exceptional in that they were applied to Europeans within Europe, rather than to colonized populations in the [Global South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_South).
