> But one interesting thing I find is if you have things that are very on grid and have one that is completely free, you can play with the free one and the way that it interacts with the other instances creates polyrhythms at times.
> 
> I simply map the amount generally and the free frequency to pots on the Launch Control XL, and it just gives me a very playful, quick way of just adding rhythmic articulation to a chord. It's amazing to do, actually, because if other music is playing and you can just bring in a sensation of rhythm that's completely different from what else is going on, you can play with the tension between the grid and the non-grid.
> 
> That's very interesting to use live because you can just create a lot of momentum with a simple droned chord.
