> Cyclomatic complexity is a measurement developed by Thomas McCabe to determine the stability and level of confidence in a program. It measures the number of linearly-independent paths through a program module. Programs with lower Cyclomatic complexity are easier to understand and less risky to modify.

[Ruby has a linter](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/rubocop/RuboCop/Cop/Metrics/CyclomaticComplexity) you can use to guard against this.

I have liked monitoring this, but other developers don't like it.
