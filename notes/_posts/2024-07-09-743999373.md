> Once you make your request it will hang for several minutes. If by some miracle nothing breaks then you’ll eventually get back an HTTP response, exactly as if you’d sent the request over the normal internet like a normal person. The only difference is that it didn’t cost you anything. You will now almost certainly pay for wi-fi, because your curiosity has been satisfied and your time on this earth is very short.
