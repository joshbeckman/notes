> Delta events are good at capturing the intent behind the creation of the event, and provides context for the event's consumers. A cart fact models the portion of the cart state that we want to publicly expose
> 
> to other consumer services in our organization. With delta modeling, we instead select specific state transitions, and build a model that describes the change, not the state. Delta events are very well-suited for exposing specific transitions in a system to downstream subscribers. Delta events provide a partial set of information that is usable for the consumers to act upon with their own business logic.
