> You are never dedicated to something you have complete confidence in. No one is fanatically shouting that the sun is going to rise tomorrow. They know itâ€™s going to rise tomorrow. When people are fanatically dedicated to political or religious faiths or any other kinds of dogmas or goals, itâ€™s always because these dogmas or goals are in doubt.

Things that you are completely confident about are _assumptions_, not beliefs.
