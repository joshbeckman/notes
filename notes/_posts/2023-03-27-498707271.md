> The **door-in-the-face technique** is a [compliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(psychology)) method commonly studied in [social psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door-in-the-face_technique#cite_note-Cialdini_et_al._(1975)-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door-in-the-face_technique#cite_note-Perloff-2) The persuader attempts to convince the respondent to comply by making a large request that the respondent will most likely turn down, much like a metaphorical slamming of a door in the persuader's face. The respondent is then more likely to agree to a second, more reasonable request, than if that same request is made in isolation.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door-in-the-face_technique#cite_note-Cialdini_et_al._(1975)-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door-in-the-face_technique#cite_note-Perloff-2) The DITF technique can be contrasted with the [foot-in-the-door (FITD) technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-in-the-door_technique), in which a persuader begins with a small request and gradually increases the demands of each request.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door-in-the-face_technique#cite_note-Perloff-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door-in-the-face_technique#cite_note-Pascual_&_GuÃ©guen_(2005)-3) Both the FITD and DITF techniques increase the likelihood a respondent will agree to the second request.
