> A bay is a noun only if water is dead. When bay is a noun, it is defined by humans, trapped between its shores and contained by the word. But the verb _wiikwegamaa_ - to be a bay - releases the water from bondage and lets it live. "To be a bay" holds the wonder that, for this moment, the living water has decided to shelter itself between these shores, conversing with cedar roots and a flock of baby mergansers. Because it could do otherwise become a stream or an ocean or a waterfall, and there are verbs for that, too.

> To be a hill, to be a sandy beach, to be a Saturday, all are possible verbs in a world where everything is alive. Water, land, and even a day, the language a mirror for seeing the animacy of the world, the life that pulses through all things, through pines and nuthatches and mushrooms.

This is the grammar of animacy. Animate objects have wants and needs, just as you do.

[As Alan Watts says](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/678877056), every object with any amount of consciousness regards itself as a person. And every conflict is harmony at a higher or lower level.
