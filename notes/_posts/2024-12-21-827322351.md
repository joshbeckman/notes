> five different patterns for workflows in detail:
> 
> - Prompt chaining, e.g. generating a document and then translating it to a separate language as a second LLM call
> - Routing, where an initial LLM call decides which model or call should be used next (sending easy tasks to Haiku and harder tasks to Sonnet, for example)
> - Parallelization, where a task is broken up and run in parallel (e.g. image-to-text on multiple document pages at once) or processed by some kind of voting mechanism
> - Orchestrator-workers, where a orchestrator triggers multiple LLM calls that are then synthesized together, for example running searches against multiple sources and combining the results
> - Evaluator-optimizer, where one model checks the work of another in a loop
