> When they set off, one by one, first in the sprint, then the first shootout, what struck me was how quiet the cars were. This makes sense to me as someone who once studied acoustics in graduate school. Formula 1, again like sword fighting, is about an economy of motion. Noise is a hallmark of mechanical inefficiency. [[When mechanical systems work well, they work quietly. Noise at its core is excess energy.::highlight]] In Formula 1 cars, being perfect machines, that energy is redirected where it could be of use.

Smooth is fast. Quiet is smooth.
