> In order to uncover our customer’s perceptions towards our product’s attributes, we need to use **the Kano questionnaire**. It consists of a pair of questions for each feature we want to evaluate:
> 
> •   One asks our customers how they feel **if they have the feature**;
> •   The other asks how they feel **if they did not have the feature**.
> 
> The first question is called the *functional* form and the second one is the *dysfunctional* form (they’re also called *positive* and *negative* by [Jan Moorman](https://uxmag.com/articles/leveraging-the-kano-model-for-optimal-results).) These are not open-ended questions, though. There are very specific options we should use. To each “how do you feel if you had / did not have this feature”, the possible answers are:
> 
> •   I like it
> •   I expect it
> •   I am neutral
> •   I can tolerate it
> •   I dislike it
