> You can give yourself back time by leaving meetings gracefully.
> 
> Saying something like, “I think I’ve contributed all I can to this session,” signals to the other participants that you are trying to contribute all you can, while also giving them an opening to keep your time if they need it.
> 
> Just declining or leaving meetings without feedback doesn’t help organizers understand why you are skipping.
