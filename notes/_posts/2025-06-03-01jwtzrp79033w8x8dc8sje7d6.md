This is a good overview of concerns for a monorepo implementation (which we are migrating to at Shopify). 

I really think all these problems can be solved in a polyrepo world, especially if you've started your polyrepo structure with a few mandatory inspection/insertion points. I'll expand on this in a future post.

> The greatest power and biggest lie of the monorepo is that it is possible to make atomic commits across your entire codebase. While this is objectively true from a code perspective (you certainly can land a PR that, for example, renames a function across your entire codebase), this is not true from a deployment perspective, and this dangerous lie will cause incidents.

I feel like the monorepo is [forcing a stateless model](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/795643179) onto an inherently stateful (because it is so distributed in runtime/space) system and then backfilling support for that state management.
