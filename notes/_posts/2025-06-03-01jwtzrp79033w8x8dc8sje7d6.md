This is a good overview of concerns for a monorepo implementation (which we are migrating to at Shopify). 

I really think all these problems can be solved in a polyrepo world, especially if you've started your polyrepo structure with a few mandatory inspection/insertion points. I'll expand on this in a future post.

> The greatest power and biggest lie of the monorepo is that it is possible to make atomic commits across your entire codebase. While this is objectively true from a code perspective (you certainly can land a PR that, for example, renames a function across your entire codebase), this is not true from a deployment perspective, and this dangerous lie will cause incidents.

I feel like the monorepo is [forcing a stateless model](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/795643179) onto an inherently stateful (because it is so distributed in runtime/space) system and then backfilling support for that state management.

I also feel like the monorepo promises lower maintenance through reduced package ecosystem friction (e.g. [federation is expensive](https://notes.billmill.org/blog/2025/06/Federation_is_extremely_expensive.html), you can link directly to the package), but does it come at the cost of tighter coupling? We've seen that componentization [reduces maintenance](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/332338192) in the open-source setting.

Is a monorepo [coding the volume](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/681443100) instead of coding the perimeter?

Maybe monorepos attempt to paper over the fundamental distributed systems challenges rather than acknowledge and design around them. You can't git-commit your way out of the CAP theorem, no matter how much tooling you build.

Maybe there's a fundamental systems engineering truth: architectural decisions that work at the code level often break down at the operational level. The monorepo creates a false sense of atomicity that doesn't survive contact with the distributed reality of deployment infrastructure. Atomic commits are an [optimistic assumption in a distributed system](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/612841017).
