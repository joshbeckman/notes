> A rhetorical innovation rambling attempt to ask if this is anything: A common political debate is how much to worry about different kinds of inequalities, versus rising tides lifting all boats (or if you’re against that, ‘trickle-down economics.’) How much should we worry about inequalities of wealth? Consumption? Power?
> 
> [Where the best reason to worry](https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1821148196950732892) about it, I think, is if those differences lead to self-perpetuating differences in power.

> That’s the key. You can not only absolutely fix it after the fact if allowed to, there is not even anything to fix. Other people benefit more, you still benefit, it’s fine so long as you also do better. But if this means you are permanently disempowered, then it’s not fine.
