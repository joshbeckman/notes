> Coming back to GPS, somebody who realised the importance of mapping data very, very early was [Steve Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Coast) and in 2004 he founded [OpenStreetMap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap) (Wikipedia). OSM is the free, contributor-based mapping layer that - I understand - kept both Microsoft and Apple in the mapping game, and prevented it mapping from becoming a Google monopoly.
> 
> ASIDE #1. Shout out to fellow participants of the locative media movement and anyone who remembers Ben Russell’s stunning [headmap manifesto](http://www.technoccult.net/wp-content/uploads/library/headmap-manifesto.pdf) (PDF) from 1999. AI desperately needs this analysis of possibilities and power.
> 
> ASIDE #2. I often come back to mapping as an analogy for large language models. There are probably half a dozen global maps in existence. I don’t know how much they cost, but let’s guess a billion to create and a billion a year to maintain, order of magnitude. A top class AI model is probably the same, all in. So we can expect similar dynamics.
> 
> OpenStreetMap was the bulwark we needed *then.*
> 
> Today what we need is probably something different. Not something open but - perhaps - something closed.
> 
> We need the librarians
> 
> The future needs trusted, uncontaminated, complete training data.
> 
> From the point of view of national interests, each country (or each trading bloc) will need its own training data, as a reserve, and a hedge against the interests of others.
> 
> Probably the best way to start is to take a snapshot of the internet and keep it somewhere really safe. We can sift through it later; the world’s data will never be more available or less contaminated than it is today. Like when [GitHub stored all public code in an Arctic vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault/) (02/02/2020): a very-long-term archival facility 250 meters deep in the permafrost of an Arctic mountain. Or the [Svalbard Global Seed Vault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard_Global_Seed_Vault).
> 
> What we need is a long-term national programme to slowly, carefully accept digital data into a read-only archive. We need the expertise of librarians, archivists and museums in the careful and deliberate process of [acquisition and accessioning](https://collectionstrust.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Acquisition-and-accessioning.pdf).

A Strategic Fact Reserve means you can do [a black start](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/639854126) of an AI model. It means you have a representative set of truth and important knowledge that people can use to bootstrap an AI model or fine-tune a model for specific purpose or test a model for tainting/bias.

My personal blog/site is pretty much *my own personal strategic fact reserve*!
