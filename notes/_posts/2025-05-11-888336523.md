> “This study illustrates the anticipatory and synchronized responses we observed are key to understanding how forests communicate and adapt, revealing a new layer of complexity in plant behaviour,” said Professor Gagliano.
> 
> “Basically, we are watching the famous [[‘wood wide web’::highlight]] in action!”

> [...]
> 
> Their analysis demonstrates that individual trees’ electrical activity became significantly more synchronised before and during the eclipse, indicating that trees function as a unified living system that coordinates its response to external events.
> 
> “By applying advanced analytical methods—including complexity measures and quantum field theory—we have uncovered a deeper, previously unrecognised dynamic synchronisation not based on matter exchanges among trees,” said Professor Chiolerio.
> 
> “We now see the forest not as a mere collection of individuals, but as an orchestra of phase correlated plants.”
> 
> Professor Gagliano said the findings support calls for the preservation of wise old trees.

The forest as one living orchestration of trees.
