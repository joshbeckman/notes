> Anyone who has ever had a wristwatch of similar tech should know how hard it is to get anything like precision out of those things. It's a millimeter sized button with a millimeter depth of press and could easily need half a second of jabbing at it to get it to trigger. It's for measuring your mile times in minutes, not fractions of a second fall times.
> 
> Naturally, our data was total, utter crap. Any sensible analysis would have error bars that, if you treat the problem linearly, would have put 0 and negative numbers within our error bars. I dutifully crunched the numbers and determined that the gravitational constant was something like 6.8m/s^2 and turned it in.
> 
> Naturally, I got a failing grade, because that's not particularly close, and no matter how many times you are solemnly assured otherwise, you are *never* graded on whether you did your best and honestly report what you observe. From grade school on, you are graded on whether or not the grading authority likes the results you got. You might hope that there comes some point in your career where that stops being the case, but as near as I can tell, it literally never does. Right on up to professorships, this is how science *really* works.
> 
> The lesson is taught early and often. It often sort of baffles me when *other* people are baffled at how often this happens in science, because it more-or-less *always* happens. Science proceeds despite this, not because of it.

Conduct your own experiments. You might not get reliable data, but you learn that reality has a surprising amount of detail, that reference is extremely important/dangerous/valuable, and that you operate in a group.
