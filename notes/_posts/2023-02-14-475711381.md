> [Athletes and musicians pursue virtuosity in fundamental skills much more rigorously than knowledge workers do](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4qhD8UwNAmJDdJUC36BUGp5PEUfgfzZXvkhB). One likely reason is that athletes/musicians engage in [Deliberate practice, after Ericsson](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2duRd5eisRomSgxr88Semkgs15pgMRVVR5C)‚Äîthat is, activities focused specifically on improving skills.
> 
> Sure, knowledge workers regularly take on ‚Äúgrowth opportunities,‚Äù like a new job that will push them beyond their prior skill sets. But their day-to-day activities are focused on *doing the job,* not (usually) on building whatever skills are deficient. This is akin to a soccer player only playing games as a way to get in shape, rather than lifting weights and running drills. [Typical work and performance environments don‚Äôt constitute deliberate practice](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3n21KMcMZtfT5wmLi1V5ovzZoyqhciQowRXm).
