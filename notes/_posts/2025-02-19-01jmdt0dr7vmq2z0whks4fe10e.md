It's so interesting that users are valuing the agent (product) so much more *because* it takes a long time to respond. They imbue it with a lot of effort, saying it's saving them so much time.

But I agree with swyx that this is a honeymoon phase. And the users will want it to just be as fast as possible in the future.
