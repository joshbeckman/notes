> systems that preserve transparency into the mechanisms of their inner workings encourage more mindful, deliberate use based in reality because people develop knowledge through use. (This stands in contrast to a system whose inner workings are opaque and therefore antithetical to developing knowledge because they reveal no [seams](https://adactio.com/journal/6786) to their true nature.)

What things are you deliberatly leaving *out* of the product? How might you reveal the innerworkings of the product such that the user better understands and therefore better *uses* the product?

Can you "articulate the value of absence" - _elegance_?
