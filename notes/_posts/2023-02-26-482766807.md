> The bottom line is this; in modern multicore, multi-CPU devices, the CPU itself is now basically a network, the intercommunication between all the CPUs is another network, and calls to disk I/O are effectively another. There are good reasons why network programming is done asynchronously, and you should consider that for your own application development too.
> 
> It fundamentally changes the way Linux applications are to be designed: Instead of a flow of code that issues syscalls when needed, that have to think about whether or not a file is ready, they naturally become an event-loop that constantly add things to a shared buffer, deals with the previous entries that completed, rinse, repeat.

Everything is an event loop. Every call is I/O that can be sent asynchronously.
