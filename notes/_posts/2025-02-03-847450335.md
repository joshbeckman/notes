> I really, really, really think that there  is not a single person on this planet who is even close to being at their maximum potential. I just think everyone is way, way, way, way, way better than they think.  And the reason why we're not performing at this level is a series of ideas, maybe certain  approaches for cultivating our skills and our crafts that have not yet been discovered and, therefore, we could not take advantage of them. 
> 
> It's an environment that just narrows the focus on fairly unambitious things, at which point you get stuck competing with literally everyone else in the world because everyone's unambitious. 
> 
> I have found that reminding people of their own potential constantly is actually a wonderful thing to do.
