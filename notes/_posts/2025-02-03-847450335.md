> I really, really, really think that there  is not a single person on this planet who   is even close to being at their maximum  potential. I just think everyone is way,  
> 
> way, way, way, way better than they think.  And the reason why we're not performing at   this level is a series of ideas, maybe certain  approaches for cultivating our skills and our   crafts that have not yet been discovered and,  therefore, we could not take advantage of them.   It's an environment that just narrows the focus on  fairly unambitious things at which point you get   stuck competing with literally everyone else  in the world because everyone's unambitious.

> I have found that reminding people of their own  potential constantly is actually a wonderful   thing to do.
