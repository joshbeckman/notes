> the Toyota Production System. Among its many key principles is a philosophy called Jidoka, which Toyota says is "roughly translated as 'automation with a human touch."" If a worker notices something wrong, the worker is supposed to report it, sometimes even stopping the entire assembly line if a faulty part is about to proceed to the next station. (A special cord, called an **andon**, stops the assembly line and alerts the expert crew.) Experts converge upon the problem area to determine the cause.
