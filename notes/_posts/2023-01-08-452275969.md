> One publication well-known enough by cognoscenti to get namechecked in The Big Short (movie edition) is Grant’s Interest Rate Observer. It has cranked out two issues a month since 1983. Grant’s is both for historical and brand positioning reasons heavily tied up with the personal brand of Jim Grant, and is stubbornly independent.
