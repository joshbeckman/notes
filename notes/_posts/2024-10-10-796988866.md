> Exceptions or edge cases add additional states.
> 
> To fight the explosion of state count (and the intermediate states *those* generate), you have a couple powerful tools:
> 
> 1. Identifying and routing out divergent items (aka ensuring items get more similar as they progress through automation)
> 2. Reunifying divergent paths, instead of building branches
> 
> Well-designed automation should look like a funnel, rather than a subway map.
> 
> If you want to go back and automate a class of work that's being routed out, write a *new* automation flow explicitly targeting it. Don't try and kludge into into some giant spaghetti monolith that can handle everything.
> 
> PS: This also has the side effect of simplifying and concluding discussions about "What should we do in this circumstance?" with other stakeholders. Which for more complex multi-type cases can be never-ending.

Still not sure if I'm 100% on board with this guidance, but I *think* I like it.
