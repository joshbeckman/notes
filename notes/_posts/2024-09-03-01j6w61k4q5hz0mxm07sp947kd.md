Q: Why didn‚Äôt UBI work out?  

A: UBI did not work out as hoped primarily due to disappointing results from studies, which showed minimal positive impacts on productivity and income, with many participants choosing to spend more time on leisure rather than work. The limited duration and scope of the trials also meant they could not capture long-term behavioral changes or broader economic effects, leading to skepticism about the viability of UBI as an effective strategy for redistribution.

Q: What does the author think about the UBI paper?  

A: The author recognizes the UBI paper as an important and well-executed study despite its disappointing results, which he believes reduce the plausibility of optimistic scenarios for UBI. He appreciates the rigorous methodology and transparency of the authors but suggests that the findings indicate limited positive effects and may imply that UBI is not the most effective strategy for redistribution.
