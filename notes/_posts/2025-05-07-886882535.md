> My gut tells me this pattern, which doesn’t really have a name, is going to be *the* pattern for working with these technologies to do complex things. The best name I can find for it is “specification repair”—see, for example, [this paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.16120v3). You ask a question and the LLM transforms it into a more detailed specification of a problem, then writes code to test that specification, then creates more specification, then tests that.
