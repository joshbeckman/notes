> Nintendo’s “blue ocean” strategy was to stake out a position where none of its competitors were present. The idea of creating a [standard-definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-definition_television) game console in the generation when all the other consoles were moving to [HD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television) seemed ridiculous, but that’s exactly what Nintendo did. In place of impressive graphics, the Wii differentiated itself with its [motion controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii#Wii_Remote) and a low price. It was [a hit](https://hypercritical.co/2013/02/24/images/who-dares-wins.jpg).
