> A bill of materials or BOM is a list of the raw components that go into a product. Most electronics projects, especially serious ones, will have a detailed BOM that describes the item and price that it goes for.
> 
> Often the final cost of the BOM will be much lower than the retail price because of the cost of shipping, R&D, profit margin, etc. Small changes in BOM price can have a big impact on the final cost of an item. It’s not uncommon to switch vendors or parts to save just cents on the BOM.
> 
> One trick I use is that multiplying the BOM cost by 4 will often get you the retail price.
