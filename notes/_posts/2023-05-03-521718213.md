> Pollan proposes a new (and very old) answer to the question of what we should eat that comes down to seven simple but liberating words: *Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.* By urging us to once again eat food, he challenges the prevailing nutrient-by-nutrient approach — what he calls nutritionism — and proposes an alternative way of eating that is informed by the traditions and ecology of real, well-grown, unprocessed food. Our personal health, he argues, cannot be divorced from the health of the food chains of which we are part.
