> whenever folks talk about failed cultural change, I believe they’re stuck in one of two common traps:
> 
> 1.  Their strategy for changing culture is to announce a new culture. Unfortunately, they soon recognize that announcing culture doesn’t work, you have to change the culture first, then you can further cement that change with an announcement
> 2.  They are earnestly trying to change culture, but their own actions and structure are getting in the way
