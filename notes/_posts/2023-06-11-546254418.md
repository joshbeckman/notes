> SCHWARZENEGGER: I said, “We don’t know what happens with the soul and all this spiritual stuff that I’m not an expert in, but I know that the body as we see each other now, we will never see each other again like that.”
> 
> DEVITO: We deteriorate.
> 
> SCHWARZENEGGER: Except in some fantasy. When people talk about, “I will see them again in heaven,” it sounds so good, but the reality is that we won’t see each other again after we’re gone. That’s the sad part. I know people feel comfortable with death, but I don’t.
> 
> DEVITO: No.
> 
> SCHWARZENEGGER: Because I will fucking miss the shit out of everything. To sit with you here, that will one day be gone?
> 
> DEVITO: No!
> 
> SCHWARZENEGGER: And to have fun and to go to the gym and to pump up, to ride my bike on the beach, to travel around, to see interesting things all over the world. What the fuck?
> 
> DEVITO: Life! It’s the best!
> 
> SCHWARZENEGGER: Exactly. What’s that all about?
> 
> DEVITO: Yeah.
> 
> SCHWARZENEGGER: I tell you, there’s someone that mixed up this whole thing. Think about it. Who can we blame?
> 
> DEVITO: You mean that we don’t live forever?
> 
> SCHWARZENEGGER: Yeah. That we have to die.
> 
> DEVITO: That’s tough, man.
> 
> SCHWARZENEGGER: I don’t know what the deal is, but in any case, it’s a reality, and it truly pisses me off.
> 
> DEVITO: You don’t want to die.
> 
> SCHWARZENEGGER: No. What the fuck? What kind of deal is that?
