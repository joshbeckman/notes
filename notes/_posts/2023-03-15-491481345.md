> Once you acknowledge that leadership is inherently non-deterministic you can move away from the self-defeating notion that you’re always doing a bad job. Instead I think it’s more useful and healthy to move towards an actionable, productive mindset centered around questioning your assumptions, understanding that good work is iterative and learning from your previous reps.

I'm not going to feel great about my leadership results all the time. I'm not always going to be making forward progress. There will be external things that will set back my leadership.

The point is to roll with it and bounce forward. Focus on improving.
