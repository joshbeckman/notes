> The more unstable a situation is, the more rapidly it changes, the *less* valuable minute-by-minute reporting is. I don’t know what happened to the hospital in Gaza, but if I wait until the next issue of the *Economist* shows up I will be better informed about it than people who have been rage-refreshing their browser windows for the past several days, and I will have suffered considerably less emotional stress.

If you’re reading the news several times a day, you’re not being informed, you’re being stimulated. You just have to spend more time sifting through the noise to find the [actual] news.

This is my reminder that it’s not my responsibility to be up to date on current thinking. It’s to have an informed opinion and act on it toward a better world.
