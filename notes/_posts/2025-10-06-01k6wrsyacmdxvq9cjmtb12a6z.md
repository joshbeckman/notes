> "The Visitors” was entrancingly beautiful and intensely moving. Numerous viewers wept. Why? The reason is politically visionary, in a way: “Alone, together,” Kjartansson says. The work affirms individuality and community at once. It would be awfully nice if life were like that—as it can be, for an occasional spell, under the aegis of art.
