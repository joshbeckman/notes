> *Epistemology* is the study of knowledge – how we know things, the methods we use to gain knowledge, and how we validate knowledge as "true.” So an *epistemic status* usually covers how the author came to know what they know. This includes how much effort they put into researching it, how they validated the information, and how sure they are about their conclusions.
