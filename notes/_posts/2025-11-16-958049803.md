> But he does say [...] "a person buying slaves isn't racist if they live in a society in which racism is okay." And that, to me, indicates that Howie Mandel is stuck thinking that what racism is, is being punished for being racist. So, like you're racist if you are punished for being racist, but if you're not punished for being racist, you're not racist. And that means that [[he is seeing all of this through the lens of how the high status person is being affected by society's understanding of racism.::highlight]]
> 
> He's not seeing any of this through the lens of society as a whole. He's, of course, not seeing any of this through the lens of the people who are racialized and then marginalized through that racialization.
> 
> But the leap that his brain made was from _it used to be a high status belief and now it's a low status belief to believe that one race is superior to Another race_ to _it used to be that being racist wasn't considered racist, and now it is_. And that, like, it took me so long to parse that.

This whole dissection is a great motivator to combat racism.
