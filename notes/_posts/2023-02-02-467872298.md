> When someone (or some entity such as business) enjoys a particular freedom, the way they exercise it is meaningful. Inaction is a form of complicity; allowing hate to remain on your platform is an acknowledgement of your favor towards the lofty principles outlined in the arguments above *in spite of* the problems enumerated here and the realities faced by marginalized people today. A purely moral consideration thus suggests that exercising your right to free association in your role as a decision-maker at a business is a just response to this status quo.
