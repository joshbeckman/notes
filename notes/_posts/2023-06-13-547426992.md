> We don't quite know what to do with language models yet. But we have some hunches. To me they seem obviously useful as epistemic [rubber ducks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) 🐥 – as things we can query for fuzzy answers, bounce ideas off, and think through problems with. They can help strengthen our own critical thinking and reasoning abilities in the same way a good debate partner does.

Bring the LLM to the editing and thinking process, rather than exiting into a chat interface with no affordances.
