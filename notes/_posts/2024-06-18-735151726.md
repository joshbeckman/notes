The "dam of water, ready to flow". The "mountain of rocks, read to tumble". Very useful analogy for when you're thinking about where to use LLMs/AI in products. Where can you guide it to erode or dam it to provide a useful potential energy?

Reminds me of the [build around the warp core](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/522283598) mentality as well.
