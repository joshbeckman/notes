> Last year I moved onto a street that had a ton of litter. I lived with it for about a month before I realized how easy it would be to walk a loop and pick it all up. For the first six weeks or so, I would fill two 20L garbage bags and by the next weekend, there would be another 40L of garbage waiting for me. Then something great happened: the amount of litter began decreasing. Soon I only needed to take one bag with me and recently I've been coming home with it only half full. Keeping the street clean has actually led to fewer people littering in the first place. It's a really great feeling to see such an improvement for so little effort and I would encourage anyone who enjoys walking outside to give it a try.
