> Half the time, we end up with more than +25 % return – the median return is around 6 % per year.33 The stock market is often quoted as returning 8 % per year, but this is a mistaken calculation for several reasons: it is computed pre-cost, without adjusting for inflation, and it’s taking the arithmetic mean, which is not indicative of what one actually gets with compounding. Then again, around 7 % of the time, we end up with more than a -25 % drawdown. A -25 % drawdown shouldn’t be catastrophic to our life plans, but it comes with [a hidden cost due to how money compounds](https://entropicthoughts.com/do-stonks-go-up/the-misunderstood-kelly-criterion.html): a -25 % drawdown needs a +33 % gain to recover.

> How much an investment wobbles on its way up is known as its *volatility*. Finance people like to compare how much an investment goes up to its volatility, and this is known as *risk-adjusted return*. A common measure of risk-adjusted return is the *Sharpe ratio*, which is the median yearly return divided by the standard deviation of yearly return.

always err on the side of overestimating volatility - it has an outsized impact.
