> The four common archetypes of Staff-plus roles I encountered are:
> 
> •   The **Tech Lead** guides the approach and execution of a particular team. They partner closely with a single manager, but sometimes they partner with two or three managers within a focused area. Some companies also have a *Tech Lead Manager* role, which is similar to the *Tech Lead* archetype but exists on the engineering manager ladder and includes people management responsibilities.
> •   The **Architect** is responsible for the direction, quality, and approach within a critical area. They combine in-depth knowledge of technical constraints, user needs, and organization level leadership.
> •   The **Solver** digs deep into arbitrarily complex problems and finds an appropriate path forward. Some focus on a given area for long periods. Others bounce from hotspot to hotspot as guided by organizational leadership.
> •   The **Right Hand** extends an executive's attention, borrowing their scope and authority to operate particularly complex organizations. They provide additional leadership bandwidth to leaders of large-scale organizations.
