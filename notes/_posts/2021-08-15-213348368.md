> Why is that a hard message to communicate through marketing, especially in an overcrowded and overpriced national packaged foods space? Because that kind of marketing is one of the very things that needs to be rethought. Brute-force marketing, where you give up on having a conversation and building community with the people you want to feed, opting instead to brainwash them with stupid-proof messaging, is not how you communicate about doing things differently.
