> few days ago I did something that I never thought I’d do again, and started putting some of our more critical logs in Postgres.

>     
> •   You’re putting them in [an ephemeral database](https://brandur.org/fragments/ephemeral-db), so they can be shedded as necessary and won’t interfere with higher fidelity data like in the case where recovery from backup is necessary.
>     
> •   You’re using [a partitioned table](https://brandur.org/fragments/postgres-partitioning-2022) which makes dropping old data easy and fast.

> And even then, it’s a technique that’s probably going to have trouble scaling to enormous sizes.
