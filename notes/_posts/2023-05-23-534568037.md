> Subsequent branch-free instructions make up segments of *linear code*. The first instruction of the program is a *leader*, as is every target of a branch, and every instruction immediately following a branch (including conditional branches and procedure returns) is a leader. A *basic block* is the maximum segment of linear code associated with each leader -- it ends with either the program's last instruction or the first branch following a leader. *Points* exist before and after each statement in a basic block (there are thus a minimum of 2 points per block, and s + 1 for a block with s statements).
