> “I can usually feel it in my throat when I go outside one or two days before there’s any kind of announcement about it,” Beckman told the Florida Political Review. 
> 
> Beckman is chair of the executive committee for the Suncoast Chapter of the Sierra Club, a group that has been publicly raising awareness about the red tide and urging officials to do more to stop the outbreak.
