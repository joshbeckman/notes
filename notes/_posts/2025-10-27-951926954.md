> I’d be much happier if we used words like “generative models” instead of AI or GenAI. Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst from the talk have used the phrase, “common intelligence,” which is also nice, since the synthesis is only available if derived from all the work of humanity so far. Almost any name for this generation of technology is better than AI to me.

Let’s hope this happens, whether it’s LLM, GPT, or something else.

Especially since the models generally act as a representation of common human knowledge/reactions.
