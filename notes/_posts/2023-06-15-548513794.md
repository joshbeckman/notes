> > Software with fewer concepts composes, scales, and evolves more easily.
> 
> Here's a long definition:
> 
> > Consider using fewer concepts, data structures, and types in foundational software like programming languages and operating systems.
> >
> > This style allows for more composition and ad hoc reuse. It scales in multiple dimensions. It evolves gracefully (and messily) over decades.
> >
> > When introducing a new concept, define a way to reduce it to an existing concept.
> 
> - "Everything is an X"
> - Writing `O(M + N)` code instead of `O(M * N)`. Huge difference!
> - [Coding the Perimeter vs. Coding the Area](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/681443100) (from the [Unix vs. Google video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ea3pkTCYx4))

> A software ecosystem that uses a narrow waist is following the Perlis-Thompson Principle in a particular way. The narrow waist idea relates to **data**: data structures, interchange formats, and network protocols. The Perlis-Thompson principle is arguably more general and refers to "concepts" like Unix processes and Emacs buffers that aren't quite data.

> It's also known as:
> 
> - Thin Waist
> - Hourglass Model
> - Lowest Common Denominator
> - Networking Terms: "Distinguished Layer" or "Spanning Layer"
> 
> This idea spans operating systems, networking, and programming languages.
