> departure from most implementations of agents, which is why weâ€™ve picked a new term to refer to this architecture: **entities**.
> 
> While the term is nascent, **entities** are loosely defined as AI agents that:
> 
> 1.  partially or fully control their own wake schedules
>     
> 2.  have complete control of their own workflow
>     
> 3.  have persistent, temporal memory
>     
> 4.  optionally use stateful tools
>     
> 
> When you build entities, they might just surprise you.

Entities are agents with persisted and self-imposed state across time?
