> Jingu is famous for its tradition of periodic reconstruction, known as Shikinen sengu, or simply sengu. Every 20 years exact copies of Naiku, Geku, and 14 other shrines are built on empty sites next to the existing structures, after which the old structures are torn down. Altogether 65 buildings, bridges, fences, and other structures are rebuilt this way. This reconstruction at Jingu has taken place every 20 years (with some interruptions) for over 1300 years, since the first sengu took place around 690 AD.

This cycle is analogous to ideas in [Mingei](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/472420699) which celebrates the beauty in everyday, ephemeral objects crafted by nameless artisans, positing that true artistry lies in collective tradition rather than individual fame.
