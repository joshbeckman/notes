> And it's a bunch of things that are pretty tricky to do with a traditional linter that's based on static analysis. So for example, it'll check for spelling mistakes, but also [[checks that code matches comments::highlight]]. It also checks that, you know, we use a particular library for network fetches instead of the built-in library. There's a bunch of these specific things that we check that are pretty difficult to express just with lint.

A semantic linter is a very cool concept.
