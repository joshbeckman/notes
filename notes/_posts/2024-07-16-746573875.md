> recognizing this difference between base models and feedback-tuned models is important, because this kind of a preference tuning step changes what the model is doing at a fundamental level. A pretrained base model is an **epistemically calibrated world model**. It’s **epistemically calibrated**, meaning its output probabilities exactly mirror frequency of concepts and styles present in its training dataset. If 2% of all photos of waterfalls also have rainbows, exactly 2% of photos of waterfalls the model generates will have rainbows. It’s also a **world model**, in the sense that what results from pretraining is a probabilistic model of observations of the world (its training dataset). Anything we can find in the training dataset, we can also expect to find in the model’s output space.

> Once we subject the model to preference tuning, however, the model transforms into something very different, a function that greedily and cleverly finds a way to interpret every input into a version of the request that includes elements it knows is most likely to result in a positive rating from a reviewer.

Preference tuning methods like RLHF and DPO change the goal of a large neural net model: from modeling the input to targeting approval.
