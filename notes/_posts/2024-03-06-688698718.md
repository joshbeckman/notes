I think this is what we're going to see become much more common as we have [LLM](https://www.joshbeckman.org/tags/#llm) agents and non-deterministic/non-CEO (correct and efficient only) agents assembled _as an algorithm/program_ in distributed computing.

Each one will need to be checking the other and the whole program will need to be robust to false/hallucinated responses.
