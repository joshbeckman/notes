> We have to learn the bitter lesson that building in how we think we think does not work in the long run. The bitter lesson is based on the historical observations that 1) AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents, 2) this always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but 3) in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and 4) breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation by search and learning. The eventual success is tinged with bitterness, and often incompletely digested, because it is success over a favored, human-centric approach.

> One thing that should be learned from the bitter lesson is the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great. The two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way are search and learning.

We want AI agents _that can discover like we can_, not which contain what we have discovered. Building in our discoveries only makes it harder to see how the discovering process can be done.

The Bitter Lesson is that experience is the path to truth and that lessons are learned not given. Experience is a brute force approach but is ultimately more effective.

This reminds me of the lesson that [many bugs can be caught by random testing](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/735445806) even though people think they have to design special tests for them or think they are untestable.

> True progress comes not from embedding knowledge, but from embracing the chaotic journey of discovery.
