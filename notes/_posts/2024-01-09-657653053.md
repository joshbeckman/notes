> **Solicit feedback and monitor lagging indicators to adjust your execution.** Being clear on your role across projects helps establish expectations and opens opportunities for better feedback. Longer-term, track lagging indicators like team re-engagement and product success: are the teams or individuals you've worked with coming back; did your engagement result in positive launches and landings? The further you go, the more abstract and delayed the feedback becomes, be proactive about it.

As your scope and role breadth increases, the timeline for feedback on your decisions will lag more and more. If you're working six months ahead of teams (defining goals, patterns, etc.), then you will have to wait six months to see if you were successful or not.

You need to take deliberate action to retrospectively judge your success on things you did e.g. six months ago.
