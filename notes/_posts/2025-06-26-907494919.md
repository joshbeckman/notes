> If you are a user of LLM systems that use tools (you can call them “AI agents” if you like) it is *critically* important that you understand the risk of combining tools with the following three characteristics. Failing to understand this **can let an attacker steal your data**.
> 
> The **lethal trifecta** of capabilities is:
> 
> - **Access to your private data**—one of the most common purposes of tools in the first place!
> - **Exposure to untrusted content**—any mechanism by which text (or images) controlled by a malicious attacker could become available to your LLM
> - **The ability to externally communicate** in a way that could be used to steal your data (I often call this “exfiltration” but I’m not confident that term is widely understood.)
> 
> If your agent combines these three features, an attacker can **easily trick it** into accessing your private data and sending it to that attacker.

I think of it as: every message from a user and response from a tool call is exogenous code
Reminds me to think about [the SUX rule](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/608689674) to prevent untrusted external code (which is just plain/natural language, in an LLM system) from being executed outside of a sandbox.
