> Here are three levels of mapping, arranged in decreasing effectiveness as memory aids:
> 
> â€¢ Best mapping: Controls are mounted directly on the item to be controlled.
> 
> â€¢ Second-best mapping: Controls are as close as possible to the object to be controlled.
> 
> â€¢ Third-best mapping: Controls are arranged in the same spatial configuration as the objects to be controlled.
