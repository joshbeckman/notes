> A big part of Ham radio today is what are known as POTA ([Parks on the Air]([https://parksontheair.com/](https://parksontheair.com/))) activations where hams go to different parks to make contacts with other hams. These are often low-power transmissions (Known as QRP, or 10W or less). I think a big driver of this is the fact that our cities have become so noisy.
