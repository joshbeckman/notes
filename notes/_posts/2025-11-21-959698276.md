> On Wednesday night, a directive from HHS forced the agency to [publish](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/autism.html) scientifically false claims about vaccines and autism—claims the agency itself and scientists across the world had spent decades investigating, and [study after study has shown no link](https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/vaccines-dont-cause-autism-so-what?utm_source=publication-search). This wasn’t a debate or a misunderstanding, and no new data was presented. This was political actors overriding science in a place where accuracy, integrity, credibility, transparency, and honesty literally saves lives.

> The damage doesn’t stay neatly contained to one webpage or one topic. When any part of the system is forced to publish something false, it immediately weakens the credibility and integrity of every other part that depends on shared trust. Hesitation, doubt, and confusion spread fast. Just yesterday, I was talking with colleagues responding to the infant botulism outbreak, and they asked, “How do you ask the public to trust that science on infant formula when another part of the agency is being forced to publish false information?”

More generational harm being donw by the MAHA movement and RFK Jr.

It’s pollution and poisoning of life-saving science by personal opinion and politics.
