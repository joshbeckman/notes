> Ad-hoc validation leads to a phenomenon that the [language-theoretic security](http://langsec.org) field calls *shotgun parsing*. In the 2016 paper, [The Seven Turrets of Babel: A Taxonomy of LangSec Errors and How to Expunge Them](http://langsec.org/papers/langsec-cwes-secdev2016.pdf), its authors provide the following definition:
> 
> > Shotgun parsing is a programming antipattern whereby parsing and input-validating code is mixed with and spread across processing code—throwing a cloud of checks at the input, and hoping, without any systematic justification, that one or another would catch all the “bad” cases.
> 
> They go on to explain the problems inherent to such validation techniques:
> 
> > Shotgun parsing necessarily deprives the program of the ability to reject invalid input instead of processing it. Late-discovered errors in an input stream will result in some portion of invalid input having been processed, with the consequence that program state is difficult to accurately predict.
> 
> In other words, a program that does not parse all of its input up front runs the risk of acting upon a valid portion of the input, discovering a different portion is invalid, and suddenly needing to roll back whatever modifications it already executed in order to maintain consistency.
