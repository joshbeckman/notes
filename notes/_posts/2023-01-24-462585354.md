> you can significant improve the quality of internal communcations within your organization by adopting four practices:
> 
> 1.  **Maintain the drip**: communicate on a regular basis, even if you don’t have something novel to share
> 2.  **Test before broadcasting**: review your communication with a few people before sending it, to improve clarity and avoid blindspots
> 3.  **Build the packet**: ensure every communication has a concise summary, link to background context, and an explicit way to ask questions
> 4.  **Use every channel**: distribute important information across every relevant channel, including [meetings](https://lethain.com/eng-org-meetings/), email, chat, etc
