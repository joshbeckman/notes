> And what you have is when you have this unequal economy, you're giving all of the consumption power to very, very rich people. Very rich people, percentage wise, have a very low demand to consume and a massive demand to save. Basically, what these people want is assets. So the second thing you will see is an increase in asset prices, massive increase in asset prices. Because you're giving all of the money to people who are just trying to buy assets.
