A big reason to have a blog or at least an online home is to leave little bits out in the world for others to find you and bring you into their community.

And this means that part of your job (as someone browsing other people's breadcrumbs online) is to reach out to others and form connections. Passive consumption isn't enough. You have to respond and say: "Hey, I see you."
