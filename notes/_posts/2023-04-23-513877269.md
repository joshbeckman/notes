> One of my favorite systems papers ever is the [COST](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/hotos15/hotos15-paper-mcsherry.pdf) paper, which examples a number of big-data platforms, and observes that many of them have the desirable property of scaling (near-)linearly with available hardware, but do so at the cost of being *ludicrously* less efficient than a tuned single-threaded implementation.
