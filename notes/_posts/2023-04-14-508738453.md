> **Inaction â†’ Committed Action**
> 
> Clarifying our values and learning a new relationship with our thoughts and feelings is great, but if we don't *do* anything differently, our lives ultimately won't change.

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy tells us to focus on bringing our actions in line with our beliefs (to interrogate _both_) - [aligning our behavior with our beliefs brings the only true satisfaction](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/671628715).
