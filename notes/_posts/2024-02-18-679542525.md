> The possibilities for using language as an intermediate representation are endless. LAIR is a powerful paradigm for transformational tasks that allows us to use language as an intermediate representation to manipulate things in a way that is both accessible and powerful, and that allows us to pick and choose *what* part of semanticity we want to manipulate *versus* what we want to preserve.

Maybe code and data are poor representations of what we want to achieve?Â 
Maybe we should instead focus on describing what we want in human language, now that we have taught the computer human language.
