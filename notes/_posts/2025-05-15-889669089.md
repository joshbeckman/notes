> I think what integrity means is you actually are something other people can build on top of. And you are something your present and future self can build on top of.
> 
> Hitting snooze on something every time rather than just, like, removing it from your calendar or to-do list, in a way, is low integrity 'cause now your future self can't trust that you'll actually then do it. And integrity is literally physical integrity. Structural integrity. You won't be in a building that doesn't have integrity. And you sometimes don't notice it, that it doesn't have integrity, until the earthquake comes and everybody's dead, right? If you're trying to build something for the long term, if you're trying to build something that scales, integrity matters more and more as a function of scale and of length of time.

Your integrity strengthens yourself as it provides a base for others.
