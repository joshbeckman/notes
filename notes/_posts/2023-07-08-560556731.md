> The upshot for the industry at large, is: the **LLM-as-Moat model has begun to disappear**, and may be gone even by the end of this year. “[We have no moat, and neither does OpenAI](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither)” was an adieu to the LLM moat at the center of a SaaS ecosystem. AI is being commoditized practically overnight.
> 
> It’s sort of like the decades-long gradual miniaturization of computers from mainframes to embedded chips that run full OSes. Except it happened in **ten weeks**.
>
