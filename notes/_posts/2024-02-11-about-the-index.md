[The topics](/tags) are categories; they are used as tags.
Any note can be tagged with one or more topics.
The numbers don't matter; what matters is that they are numerically sorted and numerically related.

The system structure and theory is roughly based on the ideas of <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com" target="_blank">Johnny.Decimal</a>.
I initially took inspiration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification" target="_blank">Dewey Decimal Classification</a>, but diverged when I saw its racist/sexist grouping and when I started embracing my own focus.
  Categories are maintained <a href="https://github.com/joshbeckman/notes/blob/master/_data/decimals.yml">here</a>.

Things are [indexec by topic](/tags), or <a href="/dates">indexed by date</a>, or <a href="/sources">by source</a> or you can <a href="/search">search here</a>.

If you're visually-inclined, you can [browse the network visualization](/network)

**Update 2025-02-18:** This is [deprecated](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/dropping-johnny-decimal-leaning-into-tags-and-search).
