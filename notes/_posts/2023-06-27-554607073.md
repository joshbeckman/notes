> Now the real advantage of tracing to me is it comes out of the box with the idea of sampling. It is a debugging and troubleshooting tool, not something with compliance or business uses. Therefore it hasn't become completely mucked up with people jamming all sorts of weird requirements in there over time. You can very safely sample because its only for developer troubleshooting.
