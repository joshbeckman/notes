> The [new DeepMind paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18813) introduces a system called CaMeL (short for CApabilities for MachinE Learning). The goal of CaMeL is to safely take a prompt like “Send Bob the document he requested in our last meeting” and execute it, taking into account the risk that there might be malicious instructions somewhere in the context that attempt to over-ride the user’s intent.

> It works by taking a command from a user, converting that into a sequence of steps in a Python-like programming language, then checking the inputs and outputs of each step to make absolutely sure the data involved is only being passed on to the right places.

Basically it tracks output from tool calls and assigns capabilities and policies to inputs to tools calls. 

Capabilities are effectively tags that can be attached to each of the variables, to track things like who is allowed to read a piece of data and the source that the data came from. Policies can then be configured to allow or deny actions based on those capabilities.
