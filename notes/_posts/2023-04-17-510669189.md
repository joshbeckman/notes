> The student who overcomes this problem might learn the following useful techniques:
> 
> •   If some expression looks complicated, try graphing it and see if you get any insight into how it behaves.
>     
> •   Some complicated functions can be understood by breaking them into simple parts and dealing with the parts separately.
>     
> •   Piecewise-continuous functions can be integrated by breaking them into continuous intervals and integrating the intervals separately.
>     
> •   You can exploit symmetry to reduce the amount of calculation required.
>     
> 
> None of this is deep stuff, but it's all valuable technique. Also they might make the valuable observation that not every problem should be solved by pushing around the symbols.
