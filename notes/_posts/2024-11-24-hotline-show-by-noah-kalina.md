I have fallen in love with [Noah Kalina's Hotline Show](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9uM7B29r8g-ZQt8riVJarhlOea8x7-Mp) on YouTube (he also has [a newsletter](https://noahkalina.com/newsletter) on [his main website](https://noahkalina.com/)).

It's a lovely little video blog where he takes phone calls from friends/fans/passers-by and weaves them with his own field photography. It's very random and he's a dour dude but I've grown to appreciate the subtle, skillful videography and honesty in each episode.
