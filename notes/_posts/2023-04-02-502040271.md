> All you crazy MFs are completely overlooking the fact that **software engineering exists as a discipline because you cannot EVER under any circumstances TRUST CODE.** That’s why we have *reviewers*. And *linters*. And *debuggers*. And *unit tests*. And *integration tests*. And *staging environments*. And *runbooks*. And all of goddamned *Operational Excellence*. And *security checkers*, and *compliance scanners*, and on, and on and on!
> 
> So the next one of you to complain that “you can’t trust LLM code” gets a little badge that says “Welcome to *engineering* motherfucker”. You’ve finally learned the secret of the trade: Don’t. Trust. Anything!
