> Time-aligning things helps make it easier to spin up interfaces quickly: instead of calling up today’s rigid, one-size-fits-all interfaces, we want to spin up what we need for each day’s work. Time-aligning and similar approaches make it possible to do this without needing a developer to have built a custom integration between two data types or services. You get implicit relationships among lots of items, without having to set up any references manually, allowing you to create extemporaneous, meaningful organizations later as needed.

This is what I want out of my calendar. I want overlays of all possible time-aligned data so that I can spot relationships otherwise unnoticed.
