> You can buy a bank’s attention to bespoke needs by bringing it deposits, but it takes a lot more money than I have. Or you can buy a trivial number of shares of the bank *and call Investor Relations if you have any problems*.
> 
> This is one of many fun hacks I picked up over the years as an [unpaid advocate](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2017/09/09/identity-theft-credit-reports/?ref=bits-about-money#ghostwriting) for people with routine banking issues. Customer Service might fob off a retiree who wants a NSF fee reversed. Investor Relations, on the other hand, is socialized to guess that anyone calling it is more likely to be a pension fund *manager* and less likely to be a pension fund *beneficiary*. And so they can use very free calendars, no managed-to-the-minute-CS-drone quota, and substantial organizational heft to escalate things to any department on your behalf, with the implicit endorsement that Capitalism Called And It Requires You Resolve This Immediately.
