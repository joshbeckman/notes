> Poka-yoke is another Japanese method, this one invented by Shigeo Shingo, one of the Japanese engineers who played a major role in the development of the Toyota Production System. Poka-yoke translates as “error proofing" or "avoiding error." One of the techniques of poka-yoke is to add simple fixtures, jigs, or devices to constrain the operations so that they are correct.
