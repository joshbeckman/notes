> you have making the thing. then the probationary artist hits the wall (and we all know what the wall is: the wall is like writer's block or the part in the project that you can't figure out how to fix).
> 
> when they hit the wall, the probationary artist quits (there are many reasons to quit). then what happens is they don't get the finished thing. they get *resentments*.
> 
> they resent quitting. they resent the wall. they resent the work. they resent making the thing. and, I would argue, they even resent the inspiration.

Because they didn't make the commitment and finish. Finishing brings the rewards [and replenishes you](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/510114372).
