> If, as on most days, no such event is obvious, I just dedicate the day (daydicate) anyway, with a name or motto, basically a headline to this one day's task list. I always have a to-do list for each day. This adds a fitting headline to the list, and is an excellent frame in which I promote or expand tasks that fit the theme of the day, and reduce or postpone ones that don't. "Recovery Day", "Day of Updates", "Orderly Thursday" - whatever seems suitable as an emotional and behavioral carrier wave for just that one day in particular.

This is a nice little way to motivate yourself and help guide decisions. The point isn't to be perfect every day - but you can enjoy it and nudge yourself into a space.
