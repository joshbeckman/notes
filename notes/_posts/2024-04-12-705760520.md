> Programming languages evolve to replace the all-powerful "low-level" constructs with more limited constructs that reduce to the low-level ones. It's why you get things like [interfaces over inheritance](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/if-inheritance-is-so-bad-why-does-everyone-use-it/).
> 
> The corollary of this is that if you use a powerful construct, it should be because the limited one *can't* do what you want. Don't force an infinite for-loop!

High-level features are more limited constructs that _compile_ down to the low-level ones.
