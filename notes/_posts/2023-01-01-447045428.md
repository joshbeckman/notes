> one of the realizations that I had working on something like this was that customizing your your hardware and your software uh makes you care.
> 
> So obviously if you buy something off the shelf and you like you get this this iPhone device which you can change uh you have you are more more less likely to care for it and it's gonna more likely end up in a drawer but devices that people could actually change - customize these computers - the Altair - the computers that you go to Radio Shack and be like I want two of this one of that and you go home - you knew it entirely. These device are still loved and ... although your iPhone 6 you don't know where it is it's probably unusable.

Personalization and involvement imbues the thing with meaning and value. And sometimes more utility!
