> In essence, journalling is similar to a psychotherapy session.
> 
> The clarity of mind you get after a journalling session comes from structuring things in your head, not in your TfT tool.
> 
> Yet, as one would expect, people project that feeling onto a tool — which leads to more time invested.
> 
> Ultimately after the N-th session, when you try to use the tool to get more of that feeling — you get the opposite, burnout, and then people switch to a new TfT app for the same cycle.
