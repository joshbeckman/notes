> More generally, Van Roy sees a layered language design with four core layers, a structure which has been independently discovered across multiple projects:
> 
> > The common language has a layered structure with four layers: a strict functional core, followed by declarative concurrency, then asynchronous message passing, and finally global named state. This layered structure naturally supports four paradigms.
> 
> Van Roy draws four conclusions from his analysis here:
> 
> 1. Declarative programming is at the very core of programming languages.
> 2. Declarative programming will stay at the core for the foreseeable future, because distributed, secure, and fault-tolerant programming are essential topics that need support from the programming language
> 3. Deterministic concurrency is an important form of concurrency that should not be ignored. It is an excellent way to exploit the parallelism of multi-core processors.
> 4. Message-passing concurrency is the correct default for general-purpose concurrency instead of shared-state concurrency.

Declarative interfaces are also composable
