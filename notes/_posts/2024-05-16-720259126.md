> The other thing about chat was when we had these instruct models. The task of “complete this text,  but in a nice or helpful way” is a pretty poorly defined task. That task is both confusing for the  model and for the human who's supposed to do the data labeling.
> 
> Whereas for chat, people had an intuitive sense of what a helpful robot should be like. So it was just much easier for people to  get an idea of what the model was supposed to do. As a result, the model had a much more coherent personality and it was much easier to get pretty sensible behavior robustly.

One of the other reasons we have a chat interface for LLMs and large machine-learned models: it was easier for humans to evaluate chat as a form of output/interaction.
