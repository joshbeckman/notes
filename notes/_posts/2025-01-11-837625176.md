> How could they get huge wins out of *ignoring* the proverbial 80%? Because the minority code had indirect influence on the rest. Changes to the JIT code, nominally responsible for only 20% of CPU time, caused random, outsized performance effects throughout the system.

> To understand why, remember that a computer really does only two things: read data and write data. Performance comes down to how much data the computer must move around, and where it goes. Throughput and latency *always* have the last laugh.
