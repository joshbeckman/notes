> I call these “sorting” prompts because they usually push the system to go out and try to find things for each “bucket” rather than support a single side of an issue or argue against it. I keep these for myself in a “follow-ups” file. Here are some of the prompts in my file:
> 
> • Read the room: what do a variety of experts think about the claim? How does scientific, professional, popular, and media coverage break down and what does that breakdown tell us?
> 
> • Facts and misconceptions about what I posted
> 
> • Facts and misconceptions and hype about what I posted (*Note: good for health claims in particular*)
> 
> • What is the evidence for and against the claim I posted
> 
> • Look at the most recent information on this issue, summarize how it shifts the analysis (if at all), and provide link to the latest info (*Note: I consider this a sorting prompt because it pushes the system to put evidence of “new” and “old” buckets*)

This post has a really good overview of techniques for getting an LLM (and any human) to actually fact-check claims and go deeper than a cursory response.

I actually extracted a generalized version [into a claude slash command](https://github.com/joshbeckman/dotfiles/blob/master/.claude/commands/claim-evidence-sort.md).
