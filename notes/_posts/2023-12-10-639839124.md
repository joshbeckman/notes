> On unpaved ground, I've spotted flags or feathery bundles of colored plastic fiber used to mark where gas and water lines lie below the dirt. The bright colors aren't just for visibility. They're a code: in most of the U.S., blue is used for potable water, green for sewage and runoff, red for electricity, orange for communications, and yellow for natural gas, with hot pink used for temporary markings.
