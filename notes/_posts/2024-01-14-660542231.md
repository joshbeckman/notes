> We could have:
> 
> 1.  Countless local networks, many overlapping with each other.
> 2.  A larger network of networks to allow for cross-network collaboration.
> 
> This *is* a design pattern we have seen work well in the past with email and Matrix. These platforms often function as networks of networks, allowing communities within them to have control over their own smaller networks but still allowing users on different providers to interact with each other seamlessly.

Don't make a bigger network. Allow networks to communicate with each other. Make neighborhoods and allow travel between them. They will be better maintained, more beautiful, and new ones can emerge more easily.
