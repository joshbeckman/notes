We are at dinner with Steve and Heather and, in a quiet moment, Steve leans in to tell me:

> When the baby is born, you're going to want to focus on being a good father immediately. But the baby is easy to take care of at the start. What you need to focus on is *being a really good husband and partner.* Focus on each other. Don't lose care for each other. The kids are good and healthy when you're both happy and healthy.
