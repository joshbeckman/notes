> Strong commitment in design is good for dementia, where challenges in memory about time are frequently attended by confusion about space—where I am now, where I was before, where I’m headed next. Memory care facilities that use architecture well [depend much less on anti-anxiety drugs](https://substack.com/redirect/bff93efb-d671-4000-8630-8fb9ae59e54a?j=eyJ1IjoiMXlmdTFqIn0.qYv5NVQwodvs9yAW1b9IqXxz-UTiPAUp4JXaRMXUArU) for their patients compared to control cases. It’s architecture as mitigation, even treatment. Strong commitments and specificity instead of the good intentions in “multi use.”
