> So the camera's tilted at an angle. Is it because you're not looking through, you're looking at him?
> 
> > Yeah.
> 
> Because you don't want him to feel like he's behind the lens, is that why?
> 
> > more importantly, I can still hold the camera at the side of my head perfectly steady. But I need the audience to know that I'm paying attention to him, not the camera. What do they call that? A something tilt?
> 
> Yeah. Dutch.
> 
> > A Dutch tilt. It's a way of letting the audience know that I'm not paying attention to the camera.
