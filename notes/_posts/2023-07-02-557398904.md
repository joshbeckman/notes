> What I built isn’t an ActivityPub system as much as a Mastodon-compatible one. I think this is the key contradiction of the ActivityPub system: it’s a specification broad enough to encompass many different services, but ends up being too general to be useful by itself. There are other specifications like this - things like [KML](https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kml_tut) which are technically open and specified but practically defined by what Google Earth supports and produces.

> With this frame of mind, the question becomes, if ActivityPub probably isn’t going to be a self-contained standard and instead the basis for one or two popular, homogenous implementations, and if federation is probably going to be a secondary property of those implementations, is the specification technically good enough, useful enough, correct enough, that a future Twitter-competitor will use it?

Protocols-in-name-only are inherently unstable and also require multiple implementations. Protocols aren't useful unless they are meaningfully specific and implemented by multiple parties.
