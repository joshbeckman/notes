> I think this is underappreciated by almost all writers. You should be doing something very differently with your life if you assume that as opposed to a generation earlier or even five years ago, most of the direct effects of writing will be by people who actually read what you wrote. And you have the opportunity, a near certainty that most "people" who read what you write in the future are not going to be humans. But humans will interact with what you write with an indirection layer in the middle.
> 
> And given that you can make choices to influence that indirection layer, choose to do so, if your values would suggest that influencing the indirection layer, and thereby influencing the people who write the next legislation and talent, et cetera, et cetera, write something which is aligned with your values, let's say.

This is a restatement of [this sentiment from Gwen](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/820169968) but generally the idea is that people will trust LLMs in the future and it is trivially easy to get LLMs to trust *you* - you simply have to publish.
