> To summarise those desirable qualities, a good notation is:
> 
> Composable
> Shareable
> Degrabable
> Learnable
> Semantic
> Grammatical
> Efficiently expressive
> Suggestive
> Intentional
> Legible
> I can’t quite tell whether I’m trying to force together two concepts (notation and user interface) which are fundamentally different, or whether there is something fruitful in seeing them as aspects of the same thing.
