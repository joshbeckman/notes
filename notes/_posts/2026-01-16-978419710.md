> Speaking of who is working for ICE, a recent piece from *WIRED* touches on something that I think is very important. “In a world where ICE agents are shooting US citizens on the street, the need for militias and extremist groups like the Proud Boys to support far-right interests has evaporated,” Reporter David Gilbert [wrote this morning](https://www.wired.com/story/trump-proud-boys-ice/?utm_campaign=where-are-the-democrats&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=www.garbageday.email). And I’d like to take that line of thinking further.

> This weekend, I watched January 6th insurrectionist Jake Lang agitate crowds of anti-ICE protesters in Minneapolis and I realized how strange it was that he wasn’t just, you know, officially part of ICE. He could certainly join them, seeing as how their standards are so low they’re [accidentally hiring](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2026/01/ice-recruitment-minneapolis-shooting.html?utm_campaign=where-are-the-democrats&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=www.garbageday.email) *Slate* writers. But that’s what ICE’s true purpose is — a state-sanctioned holding pen for Trump’s most violent supporters. Looking back at it, January 6th was likely Trump’s version of the Night of the Long Knives, or at least a first attempt. Just like when the ascendant Nazi party cleared out their paramilitary gangs and laid the groundwork for more official party enforcers, to too do insurrectionists and far-right militia members now have two easily-monetizable paths towards legitimacy. (That aren’t necessarily mutually exclusive.) Join ICE and fuck up the libs and brutalize minorities, or film it for the internet.

When the government employs people to be racist and violent towards citizens, the extreme right don't need to organize themselves. They respond to the call. 

It's sickening that ICE is occupying cities and kidnaping citizens and beating and killing people for protesting the government.
