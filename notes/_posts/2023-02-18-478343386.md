> As incidents continue to occur, teams generally respond by starting to track more metrics, such as “Mean Time To Detect” (MTTD)—the gap in time between the issue beginning and an alert getting triggered—and “Mean Time To Mitigation” (MTTM)—the time between that first alert and when you’ve contained the user impact.
