> **Preparation**: Posts are spontaneous. Releases are orchestrated through planning and strategy.

Consider, when publishing something, whether it is a post or a release.

A post is an item in a stream of contextual process or thinking. 

A release is a richer and deeper expression of an idea. A release is not just the work, it’s anticipating the work. It's updating the work later (with fixes, improvements, references). Consider versioning your releases. There might be multiple releases of the same thing, with supporting effort for each.
