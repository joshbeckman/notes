> [[Here's the thing about gifts: the sender chooses them, not the recipient.::highlight]] We can have norms around what gifts are appropriate, and agreements to not over-spend, and wishlists, and so on. But I won't always get the exact gift I want. Sometimes I didn't even want a gift. Sometimes the gift interprets JNDI strings in my log messages and executes random code from my LDAP server. This is the nature of gifts.

These feel like luxuries of the sort capitalism cannot produce, because deciding, going out, and buying something for myself isn't luxury, it's everyday. It's lonely. It's a negotiation. It's limited by my own lack of creativity.

Free software is a gift.

Gifts [ensure that the resource is replenished](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/565803533).
