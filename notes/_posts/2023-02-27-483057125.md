> this is the first important non-intuitive thing about KYC and AML regimes: the goal is not to achieve banks having good knowledge of their customers or to prevent money laundering. It is to *stochastically manage crime and terrorism* at the margins by requiring an oft-unrecognized policy arm, the financial industry, to implement their own stochastic management of their books of business.
