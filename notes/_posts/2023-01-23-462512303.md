> If you don’t know the difference between something like DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion, DALL-E 2 is owned and operated by OpenAI, the A.I. company that Microsoft just reinvested in. DALL-E 2 only works with an internet connection and is somewhat moderated and has all kinds of guardrails. For instance, it can’t generate a swastika, nor can it generate Mickey Mouse. Stable Diffusion, on the other hand, is open source and can run on anything that has 8GB of virtual RAM and a decent processor. If you wanted to, you could train an instance of Stable Diffusion solely with your own original artwork or photography and turn it into a (probably pretty bad) virtual clone of yourself. It’s not hard to imagine companies like Disney beginning to get curious about creating custom A.I. datasets that could, say, generate parts or all of an episode of a show like *The Simpsons* .
