> Bigger projects often use a formal “request for comments” (RFC) process to allow communities to discuss these changes before they are merged.
> 
> In Python, for example, these requests are called Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs), while in Go, another programming language, a formal proposal is called a “design document.” On smaller projects, the RFC process might just look like an informal discussion thread on an open pull request.
