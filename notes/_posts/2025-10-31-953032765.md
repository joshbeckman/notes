> But in a time of monsters, you can at least respect yourself. In a system that worked, a politician would not be an object of fandom; they could not afford to be this entitled or this reckless. They would just be applicants for a job, and do those jobs in a way that suggested they understood that they would have to defend their work when it came time to reapply for the position. Dragging that relationship back into balance—replacing the demeaning and utterly backwards relationship between the people and the public servants we are told we must abase ourselves to serve, making the Democratic Party or whatever replaces it work for its voters instead of conscripting them into an endless series of humiliations and compromises made less in the service of those goals than of the party itself—will be difficult. There is an unconscionable industry built around making people decide how much less than what they deserve they are willing to accept. Rejecting that as the false choice that it is, and insisting that the people vying to do the public's work take it seriously, seems like a reasonable place to start.
