> Probably the most useful of these things and the one tool that I find still today unused is right here. [[You keep a notebook.::highlight]]

> I'm astonished at how few people write things down. And by writing things down, I don't mean you keep a log in the back of one of your Unix boxes. No, I mean your handwriting. Because. Well, when I was at observatories, the idea was if you don't write it down, it didn't happen! It's one thing to collect a huge log, and it's another thing to have a system that will analyze this log (of which I had a delightful chat not half an hour ago with people who have built wonderful software to analyze logs and IP tables and watching for intrusions).

> But having done so, _having done so_, there's still a question of how do you, how do you actually - how do you actually communicate this to others? It's necessary to summarize, think about it, and I find there's no substitute for a real logbook.

This guy is the real-life Rick from Rick & Morty (here he is [cobbling together robots out of spare parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k3mVnRlQLU)) and here he is giving a fantastically engaging talk and demonstrating the virtues of handicraft and taking notes in a logbook.
