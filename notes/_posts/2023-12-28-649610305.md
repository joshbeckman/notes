> "I'll tell you. The shooting mechanic has a lag. I can't tell where the sights are aimed. And it doesn't at all simulate the feeling of pulling back on a bow, as I'm sure you know. There's no tension, and the heads-up display obscures more than it helps. It's just a game with some pictures of a bow and a bullseye. It could be a game about anything, by anyone. And also, you haven't created any kind of story. The problem with your game is not that it's a shooter, but that it's a bad shooter and it has no character."
