> I like the idea that even as our chips and disks get faster, enhancements are simultaneously being pushed through on the software level through the likes of io_uring. So even while every newly available hardware cycle in web or mobile apps is immediately burned away through increasingly deep stacks of JavaScript nonsense, at least our databases and server software should be getting strictly faster.

Hardware improvements get eaten. Software improvements survive.
