> [...] and every time I think of it, I feel unbridled happiness, followed by a twinge of grief. It’s wild how even the fondest memories can find a way to hurt your feelings.

I found Hallie Haglund through [The Flop House](https://www.flophousepodcast.com) podcast. She's a fantastic writer, one that inspires me to pour my actual thoughts and _feelings_ into words, even if it seems trite. 

She writes a newsletter/blog called _[That Hurts My Feelings](https://halliehaglund.substack.com)_. It's a great title for how she speaks - straight from personal stories and emotion. 

> When I see my husband playing with my children, I understand why they always ask me first. My husband plays with my kids like he’s punishing them for asking. He’s living proof that you can make an older brother a dad, but he’ll never stop being an older brother. When my kids pretended to be Santa, my husband kept waking up before they could deliver his presents. “I just want to see Santa! Please! I’ve been a good boy all year!”

I find myself laughing out loud to every one of her posts. I think you will, too.
