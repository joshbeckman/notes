> Direct manipulation of data - something like sketch pad - where you're drawing pictures dynamically, adding constraints to those pictures, directly manipulating the data.
> 
> Structures instead of writing instructions for the program. Programming using goals and constraints things like sketch pad's constraints planner and Prolog regular expressions - other types of pattern matching where you're telling the computer what you want to do and the computer itself has solvers that figure out how to do that.

> And fundamentally parallel ways of thinking, parallel hardware, parallel program models no more threads and locks. No more sequential thinking.

The future from 1973.

Instead of writing code, directly manipulate data.
