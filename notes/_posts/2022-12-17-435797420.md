> When we say, “If you’re going to read one thing about programming, read this,” and the book we recommend talks about the Visitor pattern but not about algorithmic bias, we’re telling people the former is more important than the latter. I no longer believe that’s true; I no longer believe it’s possible to excel at a craft if we exclude how it’s used and abused from our thinking about how we build it.
