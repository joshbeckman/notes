> Trust on its own isnâ€™t much of a management technique. Trust cannot distinguish good errors (good process, good decision, bad outcome) from bad errors (bad process, bad decision, bad outcome), nor can it detect bad successes (bad process, bad decision, good outcome). If you rely too heavily on trust, randomness will have an outsized influence on who you consider to be an effective leader.

This is why, when managers say they rely on trust to operate their team, you should be wary.
