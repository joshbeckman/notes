> The generation of a cache key is always important, but even more so with GraphQL. The dynamic nature of GraphQL queries is such that even a white space in the query could affect the key and cause a miss, even though it was the same query in the first place. A good cache key should generally contain at least:
> User information (if authenticated API).
> A query hash, which should be normalized as much as possible.
> The variables hash (we would not want queries with different variables to be cached as the same thing).
> The operation name
> A cache-busting element.

This is a good example of [key-based eviction](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/793299398).
