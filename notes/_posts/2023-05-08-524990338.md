> the tech am I digging recently is a software framework called **LangChain** ([here are the docs](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) which does something pretty straightforward: it makes it easy to call OpenAI’s GPT, say, a dozen times in a loop to answer a single question, and mix in queries to Wikipedia and other databases.
> 
> This is a big deal because of a technique called **ReAct** from a paper out of Princeton and Google Research *([the ReAct website](https://react-lm.github.io) links to the Nov 2022 paper, sample code, etc).*
> 
> ReAct looks innocuous but here’s the deal: instead of asking GPT to simply do smart-autocomplete on your text, you prompt it to respond in a thought/act/observation loop. So you ask GPT to respond like:
> 
> > Thought: Let’s think step by step. I need to find out X and then do Y.
> > 
> > Act: Search Wikipedia for X
> > 
> > Observation: From the Wikipedia page I have learnt that …
> > 
> > Thought: So the answer is …
> 
> And it is allowed to repeat as many times as necessarily, iterating towards its goal.
> 
> The clever bit is that, using LangChain, you *intercept* GPT when it starts a line with *“Act:”* and then you go and do that action for it, feeding the results back in as an *“Observation”* line so that it can “think” what to do next.
> 
> The *really* clever bit is that, at the outset, you tell GPT what tools it has available, and how to access them. So it might have:
> 
> •   Public databases like Wikipedia or IMDB or arXiv or company registers
> •   Proprietary databases like your internal HR system
> •   One-shot tools like a calculator, or a programming language
> •   Systems it can drive, not just query – like it could open and close windows on your computer, if you built an interface, or trundle a robot forward for a better view.
> 
> And this is *wild.*
> 
> Because now we have reasoning, goal-directed action, and *tool use* for AI.
> 
> It circumvents the problem of the language model “lying” (LLMs tend to be highly convincing confabulators) by giving it access to factual sources.
