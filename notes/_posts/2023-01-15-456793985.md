> But if you use the trick I learned twenty years ago from a Subaru salesman named Chance, and always aim your eyes as you are walking at where the horizon line would be were there no foliage or topography to impede your view, you will see a lot of wildlife. That is the distance, it seems, at which the animals know it is safe to be from you.
