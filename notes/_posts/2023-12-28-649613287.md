> “Darling, it may come out later, and it could hurt your friend's feelings, if he thinks he is a charity to you, and not a genuine friendship."
> 
> "Can't something be both?" Sadie said.
> 
> "Friendship is friendship, and charity is charity," Freda said. "You know very well that I was in Germany as a child, and you have heard the stories, so I won't tell them to you again. But I can tell you that the people who give you charity are never your friends. It is not possible to receive charity from a friend.
> 
> "I hadn't thought of it that way," Sadie said.
> 
> Freda stroked Sadie's hand. "Mine Sadie. This life is filled with inescapable moral compromises. We should do what we can to avoid the easy ones.”
