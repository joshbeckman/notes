One thing I've been contemplating along this line is: what about a form at the bottom of my posts that allows someone to respond right there (in real-time as they are reading) but just gets sent to me? And then I can post the comment if I think it's valuable, or I'll respond. 

Often, I don't email someone because it's a hassle to pull over to my email client (find their address, copy the link, etc). I'd reply to your post here if there was a form at the bottom for me.
