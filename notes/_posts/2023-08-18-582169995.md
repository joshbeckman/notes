> I realised that writing isn’t about beating the competition, or being the *only* piece of work out there on a subject. Instead, an indicator of real progress within our industry — or in any aspect of human knowledge — stems from a diverse collective of people sharing their experiences of what they’ve learned, which then hopefully makes it easier for others to walk the same path in the future.

Read widely, apply selectively, and share regardless. We owe it to each other to share our experiences of applying what we’ve learned.
