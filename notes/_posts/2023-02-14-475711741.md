> Top-tier athletes are fanatically disciplined about improving their foundational skills—skills which transcend any sport, the same kind of agility drills you might see an army recruit do. Top-tier musicians do likewise: Lang Lang, for instance, is still working on his scales after 30 years as a concert pianist. They’re not just doing rote drills: they’re working to improve those skills critically, poring over performance videos and working with coaches.

> By comparison, [Knowledge work rarely involves deliberate practice](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5BMvN7tZr8wxZdfFHgjvV9Em5HzXPCboardR). Knowledge workers seem surprisingly unserious about honing fundamental skills like reading ([People seem to forget most of what they read, and they mostly don’t notice](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3d6dFhTA5zTmykZ3zh4Y2vCw3aVbUxRiQQcc)), note-taking ([Note-writing practices are generally ineffective](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8V2q398qu89vdJ73N2BEYCgevMqux3yxQUAC)), developing ideas over time ([Knowledge workers usually have no specific methods for developing ideas over time](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2A9r2zcddVXfxjevj5Nzayhwxr9VuycjxYdz)). [Core practices in knowledge work are often ad-hoc](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7z6uFero1JXyANDsq7P4RzeUemPWrHD7Ejmn), and knowledge workers generally don’t seem to pursue a serious program of improving in those core skills. I suspect that this is in large part because the possibility of improvement isn’t salient: [Salience of improvement drives skill development](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3TLgRqbKq1iQvYNvxenccLPZUuJNB329uwGw).
