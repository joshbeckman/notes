> Jhanas, breathwork, psychedelics, MDMA, etc are all tools to for inducing altered states, from which new insights can arise. None of the actual methods matter, so much as putting your brain into what I think of as “developer mode,” from which you can write new rules that govern your thoughts and behavior, then close things up and operate anew. (Some people call this [“neural annealing.”](https://opentheory.net/2019/11/neural-annealing-toward-a-neural-theory-of-everything/))

The biggest impact of these kind of tools/experiences is understanding more about how your brain operates and how it  *could* operate. And seeing how happy you already are and how attention almost completely controls your experience of it.

[Rob Burbea had a retreat focusing on the jhanas that's truly excellent](https://dharmaseed.org/retreats/4496/).
