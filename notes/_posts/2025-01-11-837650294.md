> The body has a daily internal cycle called the circadian rhythm. This cycle, characterised by daily variations in biological markers such as cortisol, glucose, body temperature, insulin, and melatonin, creates a temporal predisposition for resting and waking.
> 
> The advantage of having such an internal cycle is that it allows the body to "orchestrate physiological changes that lead, rather than lag, the daily change in environment" [[4]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/W4Y7wkGEgaKemsyf9/how-to-use-bright-light-to-improve-your-life#fnoow49n3so1). This means your body can start preparing you to wake up several hours before the sun begins to rise. The adaptive utility of having a circadian cycle has been demonstrated even in bacteria. Strains that have had their circadian cycle genetically removed have been shown to be outcompeted by those with a functioning rhythm.
