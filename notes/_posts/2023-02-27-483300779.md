> It’s not like survival, resilience, perseverance and strength in the face of violence are qualities in short supply in our society, it’s just they’re far more likely to be found in the daily lives of women, and especially women of colour and trans women, than in the lives of the rich straight white guys dropping tens of thousands of dollars on expensive combat weaponry and deep-sea scuba watches for the hot tub and tank-like trucks that will only ever see asphalt, all props for the lifelong theatre of “defending my family”.

True resilience is best seen in those oppressed, not those oppressing.
