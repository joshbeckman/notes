I fully agree with these points. But I’m bullish on being able to engineer around them.

1. To combat this, I’m building test checkpoints and feedback loops within the workflows or running alongside the workflows, to give the agent explicit feedback and ensure that steps are successful or the workflow is reset.

2. To combat this, I’m carving out sub-agents for specific context windows and also attempting to identify extractable programs/scripts from prior agent conversations to remove work from the context window.

3. Absolutely - this is software engineering.
