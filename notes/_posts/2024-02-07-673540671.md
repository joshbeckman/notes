Chefs use mise-en-place ‚Äì a philosophy and mindset embodied in a set of practical techniques ‚Äì as an ‚Äúexternal brain.‚Äù It gives them a way to externalize their thinking into their environment and automate the repetitive parts of cooking so they can focus completely on the creative parts.

Decide on a sequence for each process you need to complete.

Find "first moves" that allow you to externalize your ideas into placeholders - notes that can be referenced and evolved are a good start.

[Separate processes](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/497482488) you must supervise from immersive thinking.

[Finishing is the value](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/470414314) and [brings gratitude and replenishment](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/630689495).

Break undefined tasks into smaller movements to facilitate the goals above.

Make an intelligent, organized environment that supports your work.
