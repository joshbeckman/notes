This piece distinguishes "meritocracy" (rewarding achievement) from "effortocracy" (rewarding effort).
They argue effort-based rewards are fairer, better predict future contribution, and unlock more potential.
We should avoid equating achievement with deservedness and work to level the playing field so effort matters.

I’m not _entirely_ sold on effort being the best/better predictor of success, but I agree it’s a better predictor of character, and that character is a better measure of goodness than success.
