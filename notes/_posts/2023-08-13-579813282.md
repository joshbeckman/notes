> Instead, you should align the bar and dig it into that padding right below your fingers first, then wrap your fingers around it, then your hand. It may feel unusual at first, but this way the bar can’t slide in your hands. If it can’t slide, your calluses will be negligible. This gripping technique applies the same to dumbbells, or pull-ups. In any case, be conscious of your grip, since it plays a big role in how much a bar can tear your hands apart.
