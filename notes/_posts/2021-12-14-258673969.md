> these are the three main lists of golden signals today:
> From the Google SRE book: Latency, Traffic, Errors, Saturation
> USE Method (from Brendan Gregg): Utilization, Saturation, Errors
> RED Method (from Tom Wilkie): Rate, Errors, and Duration
> 
> You can see the overlap. USE is about resources with an internal view, while RED is about requests and real work, with an external view.
> 
> focus on signals:
> Request Rate — request rate, in requests/sec.
> Error Rate — error rate, in errors/sec.
> Latency — response time, including queue/wait time, in milliseconds.
> Saturation — how overloaded something is, directly measured by things like queue depth (or sometimes concurrency). Becomes non-zero when the system gets saturated.
> Utilization — how busy the resource or system is. Usually expressed 0–100% and most useful for predictions (saturation is usually more useful for alerts).
