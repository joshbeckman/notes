> Architect Albert Pope offers a better explanation in his excellent 1996 book, *Ladders* : “It is not built form that characterizes the contemporary city, but the immense spaces over which built form has little or no control…The characteristic spaces of the contemporary city are not identifiable entities, but rather are absences, gaps, lacunae, hiatuses, or ellipses that our commodity-bound words are unable to account for.” Much of our frustration with today’s built environment derives from this condition—a profusion of voids (you can see them in the photo!) and a corresponding lack of narrative adhesive binding them together. A large portion of this environment is simply not designed, at least not in the architectural sense—much of it is better described as “engineered”
