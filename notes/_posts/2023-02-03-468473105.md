> Virtually all maintainers are either volunteers or full-time employees of large companies. Foundations on average [don’t pay maintainers](https://twitter.com/fux0r/status/1470034538923503621). A few projects manage to fundraise by selling support contracts or getting feature-scoped sponsorships.
> 
> All these models fail to align incentives with those of the project. Volunteerism is self-evidently not sustainable, as people’s life circumstances change.[[4]](https://words.filippo.io/full-time-maintainer/#fn4) Full-time corporate employment scales poorly over time and especially when the project succeeds.[[5]](https://words.filippo.io/full-time-maintainer/#fn5) Support contracts take significant time away from the actual maintenance work. Feature-scoped sponsorships reward *increasing* future maintenance burden without funding it.
> 
> What I’m doing is different, and I’m hoping it will be more sustainable, as well as reproducible for others. I am a professional full-time independent open-source maintainer. I’m funded through retainer agreements with a number of clients, and I get to focus primarily on maintenance work.
> 
> I’m not selling support hours or hard project deliverables. Instead, my clients get value in three ways:
> 
> 1.  they mitigate the business risk of a project they depend on going unmaintained, with its security and development velocity implications;
> 2.  we establish a channel for reciprocal access, ensuring better outcomes for both them and the project; and
> 3.  at the highest contract tiers, I’m available for advice on any topic I am an expert in, beyond the strict scope of the open-source project.
