> You need to plug into the community and overhear what people are talking about (HN is such a community). You’ll also get a sense of the linguistic subculture (acronyms, lingo etc) much like you learn to talk hip hop if you’re into the hip hop subculture. Much of it will be noise but overall you’ll get a sense of what the community cares about, which helps you narrow what you need to focus on.

Fast-evolving and early fields of work are much better navigated as social groups rather than pedagogy.
