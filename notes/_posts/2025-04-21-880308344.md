> **Users**: be thoughtful about what you install, and watch out for dangerous combinations of tools.
> 
> Pay special attention to this part of the [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/server/tools):
> 
> > For trust & safety and security, there **SHOULD** always be a human in the loop with the ability to deny tool invocations.
> > 
> > Applications **SHOULD**:
> > 
> > •   Provide UI that makes clear which tools are being exposed to the AI model
> >     
> > •   Insert clear visual indicators when tools are invoked
> >     
> > •   Present confirmation prompts to the user for operations, to ensure a human is in the loop
> >     
> 
> I suggest treating those SHOULDs as if they were MUSTs.
> 
> I really want this stuff to work safely and securely, but the lack of progress over the past two and a half years doesn't fill me with confidence that we'll figure this out any time soon.

This is a fundamental problem with having a computer make decisions on your behalf with your data/info, compounded by the fact that the interface for this computer is human language and persuasion, compounded by the fact that the computer is guided to obey the latest/firmest command given, regardless of source.
