> There’s a third impact of AI harder to spot and even harder to sell, but (and therefore) immensely more powerful: a change not in the tools but in the way the game is understood. Victories coming not from better technology but from a deeper, richer understanding of what’s going on. Deploying AIs guided by the strategic understanding of humans aided by dashboards is precisely the wrong way to look at both.
