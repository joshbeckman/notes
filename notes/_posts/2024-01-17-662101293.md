> [[If users don’t have simple access to past program states, then progressing in the software is a destructive action::highlight]]; it erases options that were available before.

Operating on data has a time component to it, and thus the [data itself should have time encoded into it](/notes/623459232). It is implicitly there, we just need to make it legible and operable to the user.
