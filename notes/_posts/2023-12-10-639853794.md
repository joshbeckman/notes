> The first step is to break the connection between combustion and energy, to make it possible to generate, distribute, store, and consume energy without producing pollutants. As a civilization, we've spent most of the past century developing a way to do that: electrification, and working out how to produce light, heat, and motion, on scales ranging from the tiniest LED to the largest industrial facilities. Hydroelectric and nuclear power plants are large-scale, twentieth-century technologies for harnessing energy without combustion; facilities like Dinorwig are a means of storing that energy at scale; continent-wide electrical grids allow for distribution.
