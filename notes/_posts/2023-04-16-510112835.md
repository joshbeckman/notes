> When meditating, as soon as the mind quiets, the sense of space can be overtaken by a worry or a random thought.
> 
> This is why many meditation schools teach students to use a mantra. An automatic, repeated phrase leaves little room in the mind for thoughts that pull us out of the moment.
> 
> The mantra, then, is a distraction. And while certain distractions can take you out of the present moment, others can keep the conscious part of yourself busy so that the unconscious is freed up to work for you. 
> 
> Distraction is not procrastination. Procrastination consistently undermines our ability to make things. Distraction can be a strategy in service of the work.
