> the veteran artist has been through this before. Many, many times. she does not resent the wall which she knows is coming. the veteran artist welcomes the wall. she does not resent the hate or humidity or the exhaustion.
> 
> the veteran artist resents the distractions. distractions from the trance of working with her hands. of thinking with her hands. the distractions that prevent her from working on the thing. she resents the time off task that small talk burns up so small talk and meetings travel small talk and meetings the veteran artist resents resenting the distractions. the distractions, after all, are for her: for the veteran artist. the distractions pay admission for the work.
> 
> so the veteran artist hits the old familiar wall so he works and he works and he sleeps and he works and he works until he gets his *breakthrough* through inspiration.
> 
> he finishes. **the veteran finishes**. and the veteran, upon finishing, feels a sense of **gratitude**. gratitude for the finished thing for the Breakthrough for the inspiration. gratitude for the resentment for the preparation and for the commitment.
> 
> without finishing you do not get the Gratitude.
