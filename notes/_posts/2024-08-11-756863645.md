> Printing as an event that is funda­men­tally secret, unseeable: you can only inspect the aftermath. Prints as “stains on one surface, attesting to damage done to another”! The [Sudarium of Saint Veronica](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/47146/the-sudarium-of-saint-veronica?utm_source=Robin_Sloan_sent_me) as an important early print! (Printing with the blood of a god!! See? That on its own is worth the price of admission.)
