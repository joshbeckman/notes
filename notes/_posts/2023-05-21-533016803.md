> I was taken with this cybernetic description of an aircraft factory from sci-fi author Bob Shaw (in his collection *Tomorrow Lies in Anguish).*
> 
> > An aircraft factory is a machine for producing aeroplanes and it may be disastrous to attempt to improve production by piecemeal tinkering with individual departments - one must seek out in all its ramifications, and destroy, the machine for stopping the production of aeroplanes, which lurks like a parasite within the organisation.
> > 
> > •   Bob Shaw, [Pilot Plant (1966)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tomorrow-Lies-Ambush-science-fiction/dp/0330244434)
> 
> It shifted my pov. I can now imagine that a system - a factory, an organisation, an ecosystem - is autonomous, its own entity, and I am there to facilitate and to garden.
