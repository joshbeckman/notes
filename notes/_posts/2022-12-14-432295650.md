> Stochastic resonance is the phenomenon in which random noise can amplify a signal, like putting static over a photograph too faint to be seen can make it visible, and [human perception already makes good use of this](https://interconnected.org/home/2020/12/15/omens)

The signal is amplified because the noise interacts with the pattern irregularly and thus the two "resonate" to produce something stronger than either alone.
