> so what really Google is trying to do is create an operating system for the world's information. Yeah, maybe ad-funded and with unusually good search and heterogeneous but essentially an operating system and these are all the Googlers running around writing each feature independently for each type of data on each platform.

Coding the perimeter of the problem allows you to multiply your efforts instead of linearly scaling them.
