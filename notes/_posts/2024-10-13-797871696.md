> In the modern world the rights that adults have in their children…normally pass slowly from parent to child during adolescence and become fully vested in the child when he or she is ready to leave home.
> 
> If our lives are gifts to begin with, however, in some sense they are not “ours” even when we become adults. Or perhaps they are, but only until such time as we find a way to bestow them. The belief that life is a gift carries with it the corollary feeling that the gift should not be hoarded. As we mature, and particularly as we come into the isolation of being “on our own,” we begin to feel the desire to give ourselves away — in love, in marriage, to our work, to the gods, to politics, to our children. And adolescence is marked by that restless, erotic, disturbing inquisition: Is this person, this nation, this work, worthy of the life I have to give?

From Lewis Hyde's _The Gift_.

Parenting is one long gifting and splitting of one's own rights and life into another. We "give ourselves away" to worthy causes as we mature.
