> if I don't actually trust myself to lead my own life, how can anybody else trust me? And it's not even whether they trust me or not. I don't trust that they will trust me, 'cause I don't trust myself. And it's sort of like, as above, below, like, above, below, as above. If I don't have these qualities in myself, it shows up. You become a tyrannical leader 'cause you're afraid that no one actually respects you because you don't respect yourself, that you have to punish and do things and do that.
