> if I don't actually trust myself to lead my own life, how can anybody else trust me? And it's not even whether they trust me or not. I don't trust that they will trust me, 'cause I don't trust myself. And it's sort of like, as above, below, like, above, below, as above. If I don't have these qualities in myself, it shows up. [[You become a tyrannical leader 'cause you're afraid that no one actually respects you because you don't respect yourself::highlight]], that you have to punish and do things and do that.

> And I thought that was the way the world is. And now I realize no, no, no, no, I just literally don't trust people will ever listen to me unless I force it down their throats. Because I don't listen to myself.

Self-respect is required for respecting and [trusting](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/556396940) others. And that [integrity](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/889669089) allows us to build more beautiful and complex organizations.
