> When adding jitter to scheduled work, we do not select the jitter on each host randomly. Instead, we use a consistent method that produces the same number every time on the same host. This way, if there is a service being overloaded, or a race condition, it happens the same way in a pattern. We humans are good at identifying patterns, and we're more likely to determine the root cause. Using a random method ensures that if a resource is being overwhelmed, it only happens - well, at random. This makes troubleshooting much more difficult.
