> > You just say the first bit of the story, and then you change locations and you're like, "Okay, I've recorded three lines here, I'm gonna change locations."

> Because this is moving the narrative forward. So there's a slight pivot in the narrative. I've told you what the greatest moment was, and now I'm giving you context. It's a different - it's not a different thread of the story, but it's a little bit of a pivot. So it's a straight line, and now it's turning this way. So let me give - let me let you know that with a different angle.

A different angle/location - a physical change - leads the audience to understanding a narrative change/event.
