> As is so often SOP with the truth, thereâ€™s a cruel paradox involved. It may well be that we spectators, who are not divinely gifted as athletes, are the only ones able truly to see, articulate, and animate the experience of the gift we are denied. And that those who receive and act out the gift of athletic genius must, perforce, be blind and dumb about itâ€”and not because blindness and dumbness are the price of the gift, but because they are its essence.
