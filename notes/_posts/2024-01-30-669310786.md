Of course. The way people tell stories [determines their life](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/209716641) and [how we speak matters](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/556736391) more than we think. 

Choose your words carefully and your stories even more carefully. The stories are there in any case.
