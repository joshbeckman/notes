> The way he talks about foraging in this conversation reminds me that “cooking” is an amorphous concept that can start way before you get to the stove. The creative act of getting food on the table can encompass the patient art of growing food or the thrill of the hunt in the wild. For those of us far from the wild, it can include the thoughtful sourcing of ingredients.
