> Even if you believe these reactions are not fair, they are an excellent example of the human volatilities one must consider in evaluating a technology for century-scale storage. If you construct your storage scheme using a culturally and politically volatile technology, that in itself presents a risk long after you are gone. As with every other method described here, the method must be preserved along with what is being stored.

You have to preserve a culture along with any physical object you preserve.

And choosing to preserve an object might preserve some of the culture that made it (for better or worse). This is why people (even smart people) want to destroy things from cultures they see as dangerous.
