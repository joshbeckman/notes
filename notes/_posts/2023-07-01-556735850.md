> Something I've been framing to myself and my team is 'momentum' on decisions/problems. A decision is most likely to get made when the context is fresh and people feel like it's a priority.
> 
> Waiting for some future gating event to make a decision means that most people involved will unload it from their working memory. When that future gate comes up (meeting, doc is shared, etc.) everyone has to regain the context required to make the decision, which can sometimes take days.
> 
> So I've been encouraging everyone to retain momentum on decisions until we reach a resting state (either a concrete direction or alignment that the problem/decision is low priority for right now).
