Decisions are made based on the information and context available at a specific moment in time, along with a set of circumstances. However, the world around us is constantly changing, with new information and conditions emerging that can alter the effectiveness or correctness of a decision. It is essential to recognize that our decisions are not set in stone, but rather have a “lease period” or a limited duration during which they remain relevant and impactful.

We must not consider it a failure to revisit and change our decisions. Instead, the ability to adapt to new information and circumstances is a sign of growth and maturity. We are always learning and improving, and our decisions should reflect that.
