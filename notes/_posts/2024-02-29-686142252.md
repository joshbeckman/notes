> A master shot is the principal camera shot that a director and cinematographer use when filming a particular scene. It covers all of the important action in a scene, including the major characters and scenic points of interest. For this reason, master shots are almost always wide shots.
> 
> Master shots are complemented by other camera angles that cover specific detail within the scene, including establishing shots, low shots, close-ups, and medium shots. Directors and editors can cut to these angles during post-production, whether that’s to establish detail with an insert shot or show multiple points of view with cross-cutting.
