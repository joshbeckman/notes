> For example, let's take the simple question: "How old are you?" First, there's a single sign for "question." So for a question about someone's age, you'd use the motion for question with the motion for "winter". How many winters are you? That's what I ask. In PISL you measure months by moons, days by the sun. And to refer to different times of day, you would show hand placement according to the position of the sun in the sky. So this sign for morning, afternoon, or night.
