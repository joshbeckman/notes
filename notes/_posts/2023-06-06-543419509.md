> In distributed programming theory, granularity has been around for a long time. The [CSP model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes) is of tiny processes performing tasks and passing data (it helped inspire the Go language); the [Actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) has messages passed between multitudes of actors changing internal state; even the [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) is about discrete functions acting on data.
> 
> Object-oriented programming has developers reasoning about objects (not virtual machines or disks). And in [CORBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Object_Request_Broker_Architecture), and similar systems, there’s the concept of an [object request broker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_request_broker) allowing objects to run and be accessed remotely in a distributed system without knowing details of where or how the object executes.
> 
> The theory of computing points away from dedicated machines (virtual or real) and to code and data that run on the Supercloud handling the details of code execution and data locality automatically and efficiently.
