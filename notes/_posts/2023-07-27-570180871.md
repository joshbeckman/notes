> As a medium, photography is kind of intrinsically selfish. So I bring prints to people as a way of hopefully giving a small thing back in exchange for the trust and time that they’ve given to me. But it also shows them how I see them, and that’s important because sometimes there’s a dissonance in how somebody sees themself compared to how an outsider might view them. Sometimes people will get a picture and we’ll have a conversation about whether or not it aligns with their self-image, and I think that’s kind of interesting to wrestle with as a photographer.
