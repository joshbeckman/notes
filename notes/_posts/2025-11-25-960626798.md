> And now we know that a staggering amount of the accounts Republicans have been relying on for viral feedback are either apolitical con artists milking their hatred for clicks or pitiful anonymous fascists LARPing America’s culture war because they can’t wage one at home. And from where I’m sitting, all this isn’t proof that shadowy foreign actors are destroying America. It’s proof that the American right has spent better part of the last decade letting algorithmic spam tell them what they want to hear, astroturfing themselves into believing that some silent majority out there believes in their worthless MAGA crusade. When all they were doing was chasing the approval of faceless accounts who realized their political movement was so hollow, so braindead simple, so spiritually worthless that they could easily earn a few Musk bucks by posting AI-generated photos of blonde women in American flag bikinis promising a Thousand Year Burger Reich.
