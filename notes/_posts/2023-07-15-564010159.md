> Good architecture is built incrementally, but **not** designed incrementally. The [active-active, sharded architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8NWDHgWA28) that powers Shopify today was drawn on a whiteboard in 2014 (not designed incrementally), and it took ~6 years to fully materialize, with a major customer-facing milestone every year (built incrementally). We wouldâ€™ve hit a local maxima if we had not intentionally spelled this out.
