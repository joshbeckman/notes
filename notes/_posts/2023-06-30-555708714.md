> It is known that, when we learn or train in something, we pass through the stages of *shu*, *ha*, and *ri*. These stages are explained as follows.
> 
> In *shu*, we repeat the forms and discipline ourselves so that our bodies absorb the forms that our forebears created. We remain faithful to these forms with no deviation.
> 
> Next, in the stage of *ha*, once we have disciplined ourselves to acquire the forms and movements, we make innovations. In this process the forms may be broken and discarded.
> 
> Finally, in *ri*, we completely depart from the forms, open the door to creative technique, and arrive in a place where we act in accordance with what our heart/mind desires, unhindered while not overstepping laws.

When practicing, identify your stage. When teaching, identify the stage to train.
