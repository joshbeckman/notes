> Anti-ageing is a disappointing pursuit. It has been since Ponce de Léon went searching for the Fountain of Youth and found Florida. There is no point at which the anti-ageing will have worked – when you look in the mirror and say, “I’ve done it! I’m anti-aged!” Once you buy into the concept of anti-ageing, you buy in forevermore.

I mean, you don’t *have* to continue forever. You can stop and let aging happen at some future time.
