> The power of the Naming Effect should not be underestimated. It is literally the power to bring new “realities” into existence.[g.] Because of this power the various wars on “crime,” “poverty,” “addiction,” and the like not only continue in a state of chronic failure: they are doomed to be waged forever, so long as they continue to be framed in those terms.

Names mean a lot, just by themselves. A name is a story in a word. The story is hard to shake and shapes how people interact with the thing often as much as the truth about the thing if not more.
