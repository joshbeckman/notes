> For large-scale software *systems*, Van Roy believes we need to embrace a self-sufficient style of system design in which systems become self-configuring, healing, adapting, etc..
> 
> The system has components as first class entities (specified by closures), that can be manipulated through higher-order programming. Components communicate through message-passing. Named state and transactions support system configuration and maintenance. On top of this, the system itself should be designed as a set of interlocking feedback loops.

> Here I’m reminded of [systems thinking and causal loop diagrams](https://thesystemsthinker.com/guidelines-for-drawing-causal-loop-diagrams-2/).

These connect several of my systems design principles.

It also seems to correspond to [robust-first computation](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/688698718).
