> Adobe claims Firefly was trained on a data set that was built from content that’s in the public domain, licensed specifically to train an AI, or what was in Adobe’s stock image library. The term for this kind of data set I learned recently is “vegan data,” and this might not be totally vegan, but I’d say it, at least, sounds vegetarian. lol sorry.
