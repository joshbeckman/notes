> In Eliyahu M. Goldratt's "Theory of Constraints", you can't increase the throughput of a factory by making each step in the manufacturing process faster.
> 
> That only results in building up inventory which actually decreases the efficiency of the entire process.
> 
> Instead, identify and fix the biggest bottleneck. Even if you do that inefficiently, with more labor, or with a sub-optimal machine, fixing the biggest bottleneck increases total throughput.
> 
> Once that's done, then focus on the biggest bottleneck of the newly revised process.
> 
> The counterintuitive result is that by focusing only on constraints, the process steps that are unconstrained will be idle much of the time.
> 
> Inexperienced factory managers see people standing around doing nothing and think this is inefficiency to be eliminated. Experienced managers realize that idleness is *essential* at unconstrained stations, and trying to eliminate it will actually decrease total output.
