> At some point, I realized that if I wrote a wiki page and documented the things that we were willing to support, I could wait about six months and then it would be like it had always been there. Enough people went through the revolving doors of that place such that six months' worth of employee turnover was sufficient to make it look like a whole other company. All I had to do was write it, wait a bit, then start citing it when needed.

You will have [an unreasonable amount of influence](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/884465428) by being the person who writes stuff down. People (and, [increasingly, LLMs](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/884224560)) heavily weight reference material and prior art.
