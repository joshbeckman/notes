> The term was “Web 2.0” was first coined in 1999 by technologist Darcy DiNucci, [who wrote](https://substack.com/redirect/e4cd5ce6-e938-4f18-b94a-2aa21489a556?j=eyJ1IjoiMXlmdTFqIn0.qYv5NVQwodvs9yAW1b9IqXxz-UTiPAUp4JXaRMXUArU) , “the first glimmerings of Web 2.0 are beginning to appear, and we are just starting to see how that embryo might develop. The Web will be understood not as screenfuls of text and graphics but as a transport mechanism, the ether through which interactivity happens.”
