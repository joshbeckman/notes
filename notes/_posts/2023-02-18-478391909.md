> This story archetype is the Hero's Journey that inspires all software development:
> 
> - I have a problem
> - I do not know how to solve that problem
> - But I strongly believe, without evidence, that I can solve a generalized version of that problem if I form a large enough team and work at it for 35 years(*)
> - We are now accepting donations
> 
> (*) _initial estimate is often less than 35 years_
> 
> Now, you have probably heard all this before, and if you're a software developer you have probably lived it. This part is not really in question. The burning question for us today, as we enjoy the (hopefully) peak of late-stage capitalism, is: ...*but where will the donations come from?*
