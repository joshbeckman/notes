A nice read from one of the greats on how he‚Äôs using LLM editor agents in late 2025. He touches on:
- using specs for guidance
- building documentation as support for edits
- subagents for tasks
- mixing user edits with agent edits

Inspired me to make my own oracle subagent to experiment with: https://github.com/joshbeckman/dotfiles/commit/b693656d6af646bab80390d68992e2996dece3ac
