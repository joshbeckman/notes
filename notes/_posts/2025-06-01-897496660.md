> the deck of cards is based on this. You've got king, queen, jack, and then you've got 1 to 10, which is the peasantry, the faceless masses.[...]
> 
> Well, the cards represent four types of power [...] there's clubs which represent strategy, hearts, which is relationships, spades, which is hard work, diamonds, which is refinement, insights, data. You've got jack is trading, queen is virtue or institutions, king is dominance and military and government. The ace represents the very bottom of society. The ones in society who when they get pissed off they become elevens and overthrow the whole king.
> 
> There are there are 52 cards, 52 weeks. There are four seasons, four suits. There is 13 cards per suit, 13 weeks per season. All the cards add up to 364 plus the Joker is 365. So you've got an axis of time. Then you've got an axis of society and how society's structured. This was done on purpose. The elite created games and simulations to try and teach their children how to run society.
> 
> [...] The deck of cards uh is a very ancient system for training an elite understanding of society if you know how to interpret it.
> 
> And the four energies are really important. I actually use this with business. The four energies is big picture, strategy, which is clubs, brand, culture, community, hearts, hard work, execution, day-to-day task management, spades, and refinement, data, improvement, diamonds. Those four things are really great lenses. And then there's a kind of a natural cycle that you go from one to the next. And then the joker is the fun, the purpose, the why. Why are we doing this in the first place? The joke that we're all in on.
