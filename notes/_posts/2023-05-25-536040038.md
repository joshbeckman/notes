> As these stories pop up people act like they’re an incredible marvel of AI superintelligence. They’re no doubt interesting, but I’m old enough to remember when people were sharing the same stories… about Google. WebMD and its ilk are so bad nowadays that it’s become a universal punchline, but the real takeaway here, if you ask me, is that it turns out [[platforms are useful when they aren’t beaten down by ads and spam and all the other capitalistic trappings of the current internet landscape::highlight]]. You don’t need a chat bot to use the internet this way. You just need an internet that isn’t full of junk.
