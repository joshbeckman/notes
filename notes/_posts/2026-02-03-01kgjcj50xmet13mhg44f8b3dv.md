This is a wonderful dissection of Joel Sternfeld's [Stranger Passing](https://www.joelsternfeld.net/bodies-of-work/stranger-passing) portraiture series. This analysis really anchors on the color palette driving his choice of subjects and frames. 

I need to pay attention to colors much more than I have been.
