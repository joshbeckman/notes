> Repetition really helps. I believe that because I kept writing about what I want to do, there is an unconscious buildup in the eventual will to do it.
> 
> Most people read the autobiographies of other successful people to try to emulate their success. I find it valuable and meaningful to learn how my past selves has transcended themselves. There are so many psychological factors involved in personal change, our psyches will never be close to whoever we want to emulate: the inner strengths, resilience, demons they may have. But I can tap into a reservoir of my personal history and see what was already there.

Repeating things to yourself [makes them true](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/475469846), with enough time or desire.
