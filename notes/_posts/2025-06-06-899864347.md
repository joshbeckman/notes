> To estimate the number of periods required to double an original investment, divide the most convenient "rule-quantity" by the expected growth rate, expressed as a percentage.
> 
> - For instance, if you were to invest $100 with compounding interest at a rate of 9% per annum, the rule of 72 gives 72/9 = 8 years required for the investment to be worth $200; an exact calculation gives [ln(2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm_of_2)/ln(1+0.09) = 8.0432 years.
> 
> Similarly, to determine the time it takes for the value of money to halve at a given rate, divide the rule quantity by that rate.
> 
> - To determine the time for [money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money)'s [buying power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power) to halve, financiers divide the rule-quantity by the [inflation rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_rate). Thus at 3.5% [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation) using the **rule of 70**, it should take approximately 70/3.5 = 20 years for the value of a unit of currency to halve.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_72/#cite_note-Meadows-1)
> 
> - To estimate the impact of additional fees on financial policies (e.g., [mutual fund fees and expenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund_fees_and_expenses), loading and expense charges on [variable universal life insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_universal_life_insurance) investment portfolios), divide 72 by the fee. For example, if the Universal Life policy charges an annual 3% fee over and above the cost of the underlying investment fund, then the total account value will be cut to 50% in 72 / 3 = 24 years, and then to 25% of the value in 48 years, compared to holding exactly the same investment outside the policy.
