> For serious work, it’s worth noting that leap seconds are not representable in this format. Many financial applications can get away without representing leap seconds, but this is fundamentally a kludge. If you actually need to represent *any* point in time (according to UTC or any particular timezone), use a representation that actually represents what you want.

Do not kludge it as an integer, do not use a different time zone as a proxy, do not use UTC, and don’t use a representation that contains the terms “standard” or “daylight”. If you do this wrong, you will eventually regret it. Bonus points for also being able to represent future leap seconds, I suppose, but I’ve never encountered any need to do that.

Really, this mainly applies to *future* times. And this guidance is expanded by Simon Willison in [this piece](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/27/storing-times-for-human-events/?__readwiseLocation=#atom-everything) which basically recommends:

> store the user’s intent time and the location/timezone [...] and then denormalize to the UTC time and store that as well.

When storing/manipulating data, ask yourself: what am I trying to represent?

And then represent _exactly that_.
