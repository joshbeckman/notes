> The first shoe dropped at CBS last night. TV-wise, it’d be crazy for Paramount to drop Jon Stewart too. But dropping Colbert is even crazier, and they already did that. It’s not tyranny or the threat of state violence that is taking *The Late Show With Stephen Colbert* off the air, but rather oligarchy and unchecked cronyism and corruption. The breathtaking abdication we’re seeing at CBS — first news with *60 Minutes*, now commentary and humor with *The Late Show* — are signs of a decidedly American descent into [curse-not-the-king](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Ecclesiastes%2010%3A20) mass media acquiescence to Trump’s authoritarian hostility to criticism and dissent.

The normalization of cronyism and fascism is happening through removal of these voices. I’m also puzzled why they went after Colbert before Stewart.
