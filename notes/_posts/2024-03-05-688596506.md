> The SCARF model involves five domains of human social experience: status, certainty, autonomy, relatedness, and fairness.
> 
> - Status is about where you are in relation to others around you.
> - Certainty concerns being able to predict the future.
> - Autonomy provides a sense of control over events.
> - Relatedness is a sense of safety with others, of friend rather than foe.
> - Fairness is a perception of impartial and just exchanges between people.

These are common domains of human social experience, and we can activate the reward or threat state in others by providing or withholding these factors.

Use wisely.

After you identify which domain/driver resonates the most with a given person, the objective is to activate reward response to motivate people more effectively using internal rewards.

My bias: Autonomy and Fairness
