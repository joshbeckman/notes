> While Pitchfork was well received by my immediate team, my manager, my director, and many of my peers, the feedback I got from upper management wasn’t exactly as positive:
> 
> > reforking is a hack that I think is borderline abdication of engineering responsibilities, so this won’t do
> 
> Brushing aside the offensiveness of the phrasing, it may surprise you to hear that I do happen to, at least partially, agree with this statement.
> 
> This is why before writing this post, I wrote a whole series on [how IO-bound Rails applications really are](https://byroot.github.io/ruby/performance/2025/01/23/the-mythical-io-bound-rails-app.html), [the current state of parallelism in Ruby](https://byroot.github.io/ruby/performance/2025/02/27/whats-the-deal-with-ractors.html) and a few other adjacent subjects. To better explain the tradeoffs currently at play when designing a Ruby web server.
> 
> I truly believe that **today**, Pitchfork’s design is what best answers the needs of a large Rails monolith, I wouldn’t have developed it otherwise. It offers true parallelism and faster JIT warmup, absurdly little time spent in GC, while keeping memory usage low and does so with a decent level of resiliency.
> 
> That being said, I also truly hope that **tomorrow**, Pitchfork’s design will be obsolete.
