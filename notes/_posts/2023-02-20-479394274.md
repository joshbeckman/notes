> It’s also known as *sama vritti pranayama*, born of the yogic practice of pranayama, or focusing on the breath.

> Its common name, “box breathing,” refers to the fact that a box has four sides, a concept represented here by breathing while you slowly count to four for a total of four times — four counts of breathing in, four counts of holding your breath, four counts of exhaling and four more counts of holding after your exhale.
