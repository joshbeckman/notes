> I think we can start by thinking about what is a story and what isn't a story cuz most people don't tell stories. Most people think of a story as some stuff happened over the course of time and now I'm going to tell you about that usually chronologically and that will amount to a story and that really is just reporting on your life and no one actually wants you to report on your life. You know, other than maybe your mother and your spouse might be required to listen. It's just a simple accounting of your day or your week or your month and that's not interesting and it's not a story.

> [[So a story is about change over time.::highlight]] Usually it's sort of a realization: like I used to think one thing and now I think another thing that's most stories. Sometimes they're transformational: meaning I once was one kind of person then some stuff happened and now I'm actually an authentically different kind of person. But if you're just doing that you're better than most people [telling stories].
