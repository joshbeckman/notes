> Turkle made the point that AI companions aren’t qualified to converse with you about life’s challenges because they don’t have *standing* to do so: they haven’t lived a life. They haven’t suffered loss or fell in love or struggled with parenthood. I thought this was a nice point.

And as adults we imbue the LLM or AI with our own standing: interpreting every response in the light of our own experience, as if we had given it to ourselves. We do this because we have learned to practice this interpretation of other idiots' comments in regular practice - to hold both opposing narratives in our head at once. But children don't have this skill and so shouldn't be exposed to this. And even adults often forget (or have underdeveloped) this skill and fall into the trap of assuming qualification because of demonstration/conversation.
