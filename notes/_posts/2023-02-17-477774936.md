> Loss in Judo is more personal than in other sports. Defeat in a sport like tennis feels bad, but defeat in a fighting sport is crushing in ways that most people do not comprehend. My coach liked to say that “at the end of the day, Judo is a fight, and humans respond very differently to losing in a physical fight.”
