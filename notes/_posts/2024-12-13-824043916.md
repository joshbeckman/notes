> During [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), production of German tanks such as the [Panther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panther_tank) was accurately estimated by Allied intelligence using statistical methods
> 
> In the [statistical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_theory) of [estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_theory), the **German tank problem** consists of estimating the maximum of a [discrete uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_uniform_distribution) from [sampling without replacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_without_replacement). In simple terms, suppose there exists an unknown number of items which are sequentially numbered from 1 to *N*. A random sample of these items is taken and their sequence numbers observed; the problem is to estimate *N* from these observed numbers.

The frequentist prediction example:

Assuming tanks are assigned sequential serial numbers starting with 1, suppose that four tanks are captured and that they have the serial numbers: 19, 40, 42 and 60.

N = m + m/k - 1 = 74
