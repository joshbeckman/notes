> The most important result isn’t which neighbourhood tops the rankings - it’s the realisation that platforms now quietly structure survival in everyday urban markets. London’s restaurant scene is no longer organised by taste alone. It is organised by visibility that compounds, rent that rises when discovery arrives, and algorithms that allocate attention long before consumers ever show up. What looks like “choice” is increasingly the downstream effect of ranking systems.
> 
> For policy, that shifts the frame. If discovery now shapes small-business survival, then competition, fairness, and urban regeneration can no longer ignore platform ranking systems. Councils can rebuild streets and liberalise licensing all they like - but algorithmic invisibility can still leave places economically stranded. Platform transparency and auditability are no longer niche tech debates; they are quietly becoming tools of local economic policy. At minimum, ranking algorithms with this much economic consequence should be auditable. We audit financial markets. We should audit attention markets too.
