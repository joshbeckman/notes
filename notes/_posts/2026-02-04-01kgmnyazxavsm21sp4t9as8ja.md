I feel like Alex Webb's work here is seminal and inspiring but still it's just mostly focused on light and color and almost-too-perfect composition. I don't really feel a story in any of his images. 

At my age, I want more story. So, while I appreciate this work, looking at it brings me back to my earliest days of photographing, where I was just looking for light and framing, of who I did not care.
