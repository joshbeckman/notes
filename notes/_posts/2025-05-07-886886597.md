> Yes, it would be great if everyone did fully reproducible science and made all their data available and *actually responded* when you asked them questions and got a pony. But in the current, *actual* world, *most* papers are missing important details. The problem of having to scan your eyeballs past a few extra digits is a silly non-issue compared to the problem of meaningless results everywhere. So please stop spending your energy actively trying to convince people to delete one of the very few error correction methods that we *actually have* and that *actually sort of works*.
