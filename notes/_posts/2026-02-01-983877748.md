> Swedish perfume brand [Koyia](https://koyia.se/theperfumery) has opened a forest-based perfumery where customers can purchase fragrances using time instead of money. They're invited to spend 599 seconds of stillness in nature rather than 599 Swedish kronor: 599 SEC instead of 599 SEK.
> 
> Located deep in the Småland woods, the minimalist retail space designed by Lucas and Tyra Morten requires visitors to spend approximately 10 minutes in contemplative silence to complete their transaction, the exact duration research suggests it takes for nature's positive health benefits to begin manifesting.
