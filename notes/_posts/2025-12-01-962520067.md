> It’s impossible to be “authentic” (to maintain some kind of “core integrity”) or to access anything resembling “true creativity” when plugged into social media. Social media destroys whatever it is I feel out, alone, in the middle of a big walk, connecting with people, writing, looking closer and closer still at the world (not the train-wreck version of the world; the world as it is in front of my eyes which is often magnificent and beautiful, full of kindness and compassion). The insidiousness of how quickly social media immolates the creative impulse, shocks.

Here he's talking about the tendency of social media platforms to have you interact with *the platform itself* rather than *the people and their ideas*. Engaging with other people is a good, but engaging with the machine must be a conscious choice.

Often, people confuse the two.
