> the attack was contemporaneous with a bit of performative costuming that served the exact opposite purpose: the habit of immigration enforcement officers to hide their affiliations and to mask their faces. In Minnesota, a criminal dressed as a police officer to commit a crime. Everywhere else, law enforcement officers were dressing as criminals to enforce the law. Encountering a cop on the street might mean you anre encountering a criminal and encountering an armed, masked man might mean you are encountering a cop. The line is blurry.

This is one way I'll remember 2025: blurry as reality is overtaken by hallucination.
