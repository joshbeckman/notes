> There have always been people who have had to censor themselves and their responses as a means of social survival. And what we’ve always had are different codes, different canons of taste, for different castes. That is how a hierarchical society works. What we’re seeing is the leisure and scribe class (mostly white) reacting to an erosion of their ability to say whatever to few consequences.
