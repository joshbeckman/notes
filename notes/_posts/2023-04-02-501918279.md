> Timestamps produced by a vector clock take the most amount of space compared to other well-known clock designs. The space complexity is O(n). A vector timestamp tracks the id of a node and the last known event id from that node. Therefore, if there are n nodes in the system, the timestamp would be an n-tuple.
