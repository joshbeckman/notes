> The presence of an affordance is jointly determined by the qualities of the object and the abilities of the agent that is interacting.
> 
> This relational definition of affordance gives considerable difficulty to many people. We are used to thinking that properties are associated with objects. But affordance is not a property. An affordance is a relationship. Whether an affordance exists depends upon the properties of both the object and the agent.

And the agent is a person, and people change or are in different states of mind or accessibility *constantly*. So affordances will change for the same person over time.
