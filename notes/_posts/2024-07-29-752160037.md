> The problem with social media and politics is that way too many people are interested in sharing what they think about social media but very few are interested in having actual, real discussions. Because blasting out a tweet takes 10 seconds while having an actual conversation might take hours and span days.

Actually I think this should be "[...] what they think _on_ social media [...]" (emphasis mine).

And really I think the reason they blast out opinions instead of having conversations is that having a conversation means acknowledging and interacting with the other person as worthy of your respect, and it's so much easier to send your thoughts out against a faceless baddie (that may or may not exist but you're highly unlikely to be talking to when you actually have a conversation). I don't think it's about the time investment; I think it's about the effort it takes to consider others as people just like yourself.
