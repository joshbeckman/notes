> The room is architected for discussions and decisions, not just visits:
> 
> > The map room contained a conference table and chairs so that decision-making and planning conferences could be held there.

>

> 
> Other observations about the map room:
> - Briefing is simply a matter of taking new people into the map room for a briefing and allowing them to wander
> - The map room is, in one sense, a “learning machine” – comprising two parts. The planners: thinking and adapting And the display: making the complete context of the decisions readily available.
> - The physical room should be reconfigurable. Ideally, many decision-making groups should be able to use a number of maps simultaneously in the same general area.
