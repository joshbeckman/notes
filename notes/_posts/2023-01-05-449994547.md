> But the [hyperobject](https://substack.com/redirect/5f4bf7ff-06aa-4a51-b200-4e45aa670727?j=eyJ1IjoiMXlmdTFqIn0.qYv5NVQwodvs9yAW1b9IqXxz-UTiPAUp4JXaRMXUArU) that is climate change requires the very kind of deliberative and slow thinking that my (perceptive, nearly-graduated) engineering students require and deserve. The kind of thinking-in-writing they don’t seem to know is out there—a fact that is equally alarming—but that they really are hungry for.
