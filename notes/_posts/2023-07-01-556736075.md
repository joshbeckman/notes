> If you’re debating a decision point and you find yourself in a stalemate, one really powerful question to use is “What would cause you to change your mind?”.
> This forces the other party to put aside their attempts at convincing you of the merits of their position, and instead puts them in a position where they need to challenge their own perspective.
> 
> The act of challenging one's own position may lead to a realization that they were wrong.
> Discovering this for one's self is far far more powerful than having someone else try to convince you of a different perspective.
