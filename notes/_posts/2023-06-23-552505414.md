> Nathan's four Laws of Software:
> 
> 1.  **Software is a gas**  
>     Software always expands to fit whatever container it is stored in.
>     
> 2.  **Software grows until it becomes limited by Moore's Law**  
>     The initial growth of software is rapid, like gas expanding, but is inevitably limited by the rate of increase in hardware speed.
>     
> 3.  **Software growth makes Moore's Law possible**  
>     People buy new hardware because the software requires it.
>     
> 4.  **Software is only limited by human ambition and expectation**  
>     We'll always find new algorithms, new applications, and new users.
> 
> Myhrvold goes on to describe software development as a state of **Perpetual Crisis**. The size and complexity of software is constantly rising, with no limit in sight. As we develop more advanced software-- and as we develop solutions to manage the ever-increasing complexity of this software-- the benefits of the new software are absorbed by the rising tide of customer expectations. Software development will never be easy; new software always has to push against the current complexity boundary if it wants to be commercially successful.
