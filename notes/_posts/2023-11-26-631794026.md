> *Constraint-based strategy* is defining guiding policies that help everyone within your organization to understand how to craft appropriate actions of their own that are in alignment with the other decisions being made concurrently by other individuals in the same organization

I prefer the constraint-based approach. I think it better enables others to apply the strategy as they see fit.
