> That was where I caught the connection between a college education and business. Iâ€™ve always made it a rule to buy brains, and Iâ€™ve learned now that the better trained they are the faster they find reasons for getting their salaries raised. The fellow who hasnâ€™t had the training may be just as smart, but heâ€™s apt to paw the air when heâ€™s reaching for ideas.
