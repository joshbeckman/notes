> Unlike simple machines, which cannot be copyrighted, software is automatically copyrighted by the creator and when it is licensed, the licensee cannot continue to use the software without obeying the terms of the license agreement. This allows for a flourishing software licensing market that works exactly as intended, no patents necessary.
