> So here are the benefits of inheritance:
> 
> •   Unlike composition, you can pass the subclass into functions expecting the parent class.
> •   Unlike interfaces, you can reuse code from the parent class in the child class.
> 
> So, here’s when you want to use inheritance: **when you need to instantiate both the parent and child classes and pass them to the same functions.** That’s it. That’s the use case.
