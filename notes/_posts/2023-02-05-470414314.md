> When you start a creative project but don’t finish, the expe­ri­ence drags you down. Worst of all is when you never deci­sively abandon a project, instead allowing it to fade into forgetfulness. The fades add up; they become a gloomy haze that whispers, *you’re not the kind of person who DOES things*.
> 
> When you start and finish, by contrast — and it can be a project of any scope: a 24-hour comic, a one-page short story, truly anything — it is powerful fuel that goes straight back into the tank. When a project is finished, it exits the realm of “this is gonna be great” and becomes instead something you (and perhaps others) can actually evaluate. Even if that eval­u­a­tion is disastrous, it is also, I will insist, thrilling and productive. A project finished is the pump of a piston, preparing the engine for the next one.

> Unfinished work drags and depresses; finished work redoubles and accelerates.
> 
> (I ought to clarify: sending an edition of a newsletter does not provide this fuel. The internet works against the feeling of starting and finishing, against [edges](https://craigmod.com/essays/books_experiences_edges/), because those things all imply endings, and the internet never ends. To produce the fuel of comple­tion with a newsletter, you’d have to start one … send some number of editions … [and shut it down](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/newsletter-seasons/).)
