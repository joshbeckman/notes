> well the difference between a map and a graph is: in a map space has meaning. Which basically means you can't just take a component and move it slightly without changing the meaning of the map.
> 
> In a graph, as long as you keep the connections the same, you can I can rotate them - same lengths and everything else - doesn't change the meaning. If you do that with a map it changes the meaning.
