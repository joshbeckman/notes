I think there's also another good metric to track:
- Dτ = Detection lead time. I think of this as "time to detect a problem from when it was introduced" or "mean time to detect (MTTD)".

I think this is important to measure, and can show whether the right metrics are or are not being monitored/measured and whether responders are paying attention to them.
