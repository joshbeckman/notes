> The question is not: am I welcome or unwelcome here, on this campus-as-one-mass, as my “true self”? The question is: How will *this* campus space [form the many virtues and habits I need to be free](https://sarahendren.com/2024/06/10/the-how-and-the-why/), and how will *that* space down the quad also do so, but very differently? An ill-conceived appeal to hazy “authenticity” would tell us that all spaces should welcome the same kinds of speech, the same kinds of concerns, the same kinds of relationality. But a more dimensional view of personhood — and the dimensional, specific spaces in which our lives play out — would nourish the multitudes each person contains.

The dorm is for private community and the classroom is for public trial of ideas.
