> In fact, the dental-office “badness” of so much of the A.I. art is precisely why I don’t dispute Alexander’s assertion that people preferred it. Like any LLM output, A.I.-generated images are designed to please, not to provoke. [I’ve argued before that these images are, by their nature, almost unavoidably kitsch](https://maxread.substack.com/p/what-ai-art-spiral-images-tell-us)--comforting, straightforward, accessible, flattering. And people love kitsch!
