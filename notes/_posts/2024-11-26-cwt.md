I don’t know how I hadn’t stumbled upon [CW&T](https://cwandt.com) \([Che\-Wei Wang and Taylor Levy](https://cwandt.com/pages/about)\) before last night, but I fell in love exploring their online space\. They immediately reminded me of a clean\-lines version of Tom Sachs’ studio\. 

They make lovely, refined things that serve the builder mindset and you can buy most of them in their shop\. But what I loved most were the project pages that expanded beyond their unique homepage:
- A [list of their favorite tools](https://theones.cwandt.com)
- \.\.\. and [favorite art projects](https://untitled.cwandt.com)
- A [page of principles](https://cwandt.com/pages/principles)
- [365 Days of OP\-1](https://365op1.cwandt.com/)

And they have their own [serial numbering system](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/personal-serial-numbers) for their products \(both digital and physical\)\!

I highly recommend taking a stroll through their online spaces\. It has reinvigorated me to build more of my own \(and I’m trying to figure out how to make my own version of their tape dispenser\.\.\.\)\.
