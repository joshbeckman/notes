> it's a way of doing things that I do quite a lot which is to come up with melodic idea and then just have it happen exactly the same notes but with three different instruments so that it's you first hear it um on this on this more delicate sound so you get a sort of hint of the melodic idea - see there - and then it's just emphasized just by adding exactly the same melody but with another instrument over the top.
