> But aren’t social networks also communication networks? That’s what I thought. That’s how they historically were marketed. That’s what we all believed during the "Arab Spring."
> 
> But that was a lie. Communication networks are not profitable. Social networks are entertainment platforms, media consumption protocols. Historically, they disguised themselves as communication platforms to attract users and keep them captive.
> 
> The point was never to avoid missing a message sent from a fellow human being. The point was always to fill your time with "content."
> 
> We dreamed of decentralised social networks as "email 2.0." They truly are "television 2.0."
> 
> They are entertainment platforms that delegate media creation to the users themselves the same way Uber replaced taxis by having people drive others in their own car.

Communication is a side-effect of the entertainment apparatus that is social media. And entertainment is not a utility, and is not here to benefit or improve you, and you must view it with skepticism.
