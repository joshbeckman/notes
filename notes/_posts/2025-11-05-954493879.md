> The over­loading of common words is well underway: new lan­guage models have “thinking” modes, “reasoning” capabilities! What this means, in practice, is that they’ve learned to pro­duce a spe­cial kind of text, the con­ver­sion of the lin­guistic if-then into a dynamo that spins and spins and, often, magically — yes, it is magical — pro­duces useful results.
> 
> Here is one dis­tinc­tion among several: this process can only compound — the models can only “think” by spooling out more text — while human thinking often does the oppo­site: retreats into silence, because it doesn’t have words yet to say what it wants to say.
> 
> Human thinking often washes the dishes, then goes for a walk.
> 
> So, if you rede­fine “thinking” to mean “arriving at a solu­tion through an iter­a­tive lin­guistic loop” … yes, that’s what these models do. That def­i­n­i­tion is IMHO pretty thin.
> 
> We talk about humans thinking *harder*, which is not the same as thinking *longer*. I think most people know from expe­ri­ence that thinking longer gen­er­ally just makes you anxious. But that’s what the models do, and not only longer, but in parallel, all those step-by-step mono­logues spilling out simultaneously, some­where in the dark of a data center. “Quantity has a quality all its own,” said Stalin, maybe … 
> 
> Well, okay — what does it mean for a human to think harder? Rea­son­able people will dis­agree (and in inter­esting ways) but, for my part, I think it means prospecting new analogies; pitching your inquiry out away from the grav­i­ta­tional attrac­tors of pro­tocol and cliché; turning the work­piece around to inspect it from new angles; and espe­cially bringing more senses into the mix — grounding your­self in reality. You’ll note these moves are chal­lenging or impos­sible for sys­tems that operate only on/with/inside lan­guage.

I wanted to edit this note down but so much is giving me food for thought.

I love the idea of leaving a gravestone for how language used to be.
