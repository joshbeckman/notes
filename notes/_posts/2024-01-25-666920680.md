> Stripe encourages engineering leaders to experience being an engineer, in what it calls ‘engineerication’. The idea is that if a manager can “down tools” and go on vacation, they can also down tools to spend a week as an IC engineer, too!
> 
> As Stripe’s CTO, David leads by example; embedding himself in an engineering team and working end-to-end on a project. “Engineerication” is very helpful for identifying pain points in developer productivity, and frequently leads to improvements.
> 
> *My observation is that very few companies explicitly encourage this, and without empowerment from above it’s hard to justify doing zero managerial work for a week, in favor of engineering work of not especially high value.*

This is an interesting idea to remember if I'm ever in a role that I feel like is getting too far from the code. Go on a 'staycation' where I contribute code instead of verbal/prose leadership.
