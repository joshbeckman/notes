> If all the burghers of Small Town USA get together and say “we want a local bank that lends to our small businesses and sponsors our parades,” the answer is “okay just keep your money on deposit there earning 0% interest.” And if they say “no we can get 5% on our money-market funds” then the answer is “okay no parades for you then.” (Or: “Fine, but take some of the interest you get from your money-market funds and contribute them to the parade fund, or the Kickstarter for your small businesses.”) [[You can have the unconscious economic coordination of local banking, or you can use modern technology to squeeze every basis point out of your cash, but not both.::highlight]]
