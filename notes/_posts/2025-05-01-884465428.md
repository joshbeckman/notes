> You mentioned that there is just less competition. There are quite a lot of people who are interested in local housing policy, but the number who go from simple interest or discussing it with the other parents at school to actually taking action on it is far lower. And so when you get to like hyperlocal politics, there might be 10 people that matter. And in any group of 10 people there are one or two good writers *maximum*, basically. And so you can be that person for basically the price of showing up.

And I can listen to editorial feedback and I'll make this easy for you," sifts you to the top of the pile.

> And then after you've been cited by the Chicago Tribune as knowing what you're talking about with regards to local housing politics, there is no one in the city of Chicago who will say that person actually doesn't understand local housing.
