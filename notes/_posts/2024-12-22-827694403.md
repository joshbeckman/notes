Referring to [the Joel Sternfeld _American Prospects_ work](https://www.joelsternfeld.net/american-prospects/). In [the photo](https://www.joelsternfeld.net/american-prospects/e4yk27hmxjpml2vol65gstkg3icr2d), itâ€™s a beautiful mountain landscape and it has power lines - barely visible, thin lines - running across the frame and the only hint about them is a single power line mount in the top right of the frame.
