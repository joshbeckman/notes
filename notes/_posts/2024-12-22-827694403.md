> [Joel Sternfeld] is like compositional hero of mine. I think he's so good; I mean these are like just so perfectly nailed in so many ways.
> 
> And there's this one photograph this one right here where he leaves just a little bit of the power line in there just in the top corner I think most people would crop that out but he did that intentional and I've always had little elements like this - just these little things - that are like smart little compositional elements [...] just has stuck with me forever

Referring to [the Joel Sternfeld _American Prospects_ work](https://www.joelsternfeld.net/bodies-of-work/american-prospects). In the photo (
*Matanuska Glacier, Matanuska Valley, Alaska, July 1984*)
, it’s a beautiful mountain landscape and it has power lines - barely visible, thin lines - running across the frame and the only hint about them is a single power line mount in the top right of the frame.

The work is gorgeous. I especially love the repeated shots of the same public space, same angle, same light, with different events happening together. And the table of condiments in a field. Oh! I love it.
