> Once we started understanding writing as a mathematical object, our vocabulary for talking about ideas expanded in depth and precision. We could imagine new ideas and metaphors as mathematical constructs, and then conjure them into words, creating entirely new kinds of knowledge tools we could never have created with natural materials. Not only that, backed by our mathematical model of ideas, we could systematically explore the space of what’s possible to imagine.

LLMs model - and allow us to manipulate - concepts as math/objects.

This is key to [using language as an intermediate representation](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/679542525).
