> Nick Rowe memorably described [finance as magic](http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2010/01/finance-as-magic.html). The analogy I would choose is finance as placebo. Financial systems are sugar pills by which we collectively embolden ourselves to bear economic risk. As with any good placebo, we must never understand that it is just a bit of sugar. We must believe the concoction we are taking to be the product of brilliant science, the details of which we could never understand. The financial placebo peddlers make it so.
