> **never buy a refrigerator with an ice dispenser in the door**. A fridge door wildly changes temperatures as it opens and closes all day so any ice inside that door melts and reforms into a giant ice block, clogging the system and then your ice maker is jammed. I've seen it happen with ***every*** brand of fridge, so instead, opt for one that has its ice-maker in the freezer area itself, usually in a drawer that auto-fills with cubes as needed.

This is a case of side-effects not being taken into account as the device being actually *used* decreases its effectiveness.
