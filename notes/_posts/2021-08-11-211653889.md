> One of the most common mistakes when starting with Domain Events and with DDD in general is to not go the whole way and figure our what is actually going on in the domain. It is easy to fall into the trap of naming all events SomethingCreated, SomethingUpdated and SomethingDeleted. While not a problem in itself it does not make use of the powerful thing we get by adding the context and meaning to the actual change that the Domain Event represent. You lose the intent of the event and reading the event log later will not provide that much value.
