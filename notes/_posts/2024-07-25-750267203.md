And then to sort of mask that I must have like - what have I done here - I've made just a small loop of a bit of the vocal to give the vocal a bit of a pulse to it.

Using a sample twice, once to create a groove to align the main sample to something larger.

Similar to how you can lay two noise sources on top of each other and [find a pattern](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/432295650).
