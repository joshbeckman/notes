> So, the reasons we don’t have widespread graph support:
> 
> - There are many different kinds of graphs
> - There are many different representations of each kind of graph
> - There are many different graph algorithms
> - Graph algorithm performance is very sensitive to graph representation and implementation details

This means you, as a developer, need to understand graphs and how to build your own representation of them - one that fits the problem you are trying to solve.
