> Fashion is obviously subjective. It's not objective. But the way I've been thinking about it is something they say in cooking shows [...] they say if you're going to make a classic dish, it has to be perfect because you're comparing it to every other dish that you've tried in that style because you've had that dish before. So you're comparing it to those dishes and it needs to be the best version of that dish you've ever had. When a chef on the other hand tries something new, try something creative, tries to create something totally original, they have a little bit more wiggle room because - it's still needs to be good, obviously - but because there's not as much that you can compare it to, you're really just basing [your experience] off of its own merit.

If you go for unique, people actually experience your creation *more* and are more likely to judge it accurately - because they're not just remembering previous experiences.
