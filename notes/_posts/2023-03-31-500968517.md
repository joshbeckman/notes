> The **Therac-25** was a computer-controlled [radiation therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy) machine produced by [Atomic Energy of Canada Limited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Energy_of_Canada_Limited) (AECL) in 1982 after the Therac-6 and Therac-20 units (the earlier units had been produced in partnership with *[Compagnie Générale de Radiologie](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Compagnie_G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale_de_Radiologie&action=edit&redlink=1) (CGR)* of France).

> It was involved in at least six accidents between 1985 and 1987, in which patients were given massive [overdoses of radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_poisoning).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25#cite_note-baase-1): [425](https://archive.org/details/giftoffiresocial0000baas_r4k3/page/425/mode/2up)  Because of [concurrent programming errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) (also known as race conditions), it sometimes gave its patients radiation doses that were hundreds of times greater than normal, resulting in death or serious injury.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25#cite_note-Raj-2) These accidents highlighted the dangers of software [control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system) of safety-critical systems, and they have become a standard case study in [health informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics), [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering), and [computer ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_ethics). Additionally, the overconfidence of the engineers[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25#cite_note-baase-1): [428](https://archive.org/details/giftoffiresocial0000baas_r4k3/page/428/mode/2up)  and lack of proper [due diligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_diligence) to resolve reported [software bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bugs) are highlighted as an extreme case where the engineers' overconfidence in their initial work and failure to believe the end users' claims caused drastic repercussions.

This is a canonical example of software bugs causing serious physical harm to people/users.
