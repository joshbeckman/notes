> The main issue here is that, at least when it comes to online platforms, journalists both believe that they are an identity and act like they’re a community, but also refuse to see themselves as an online subculture with its own specific and *subjective* point of view. Which they absolutely are. For instance, journalists need just as much custom moderation as furries, if not more. The difference is furries know they’re furries.

This was understood in an actual newsroom, from my experience.
