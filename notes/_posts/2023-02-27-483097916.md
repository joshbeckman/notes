> **A few desirable qualities for creative contexts:** Note that very few have all these qualities to the level you desire. You kinda have to develop techniques for improving them:
> 
> - They will help drive you to completion, shipping some project you care about, and whose scale is commensurate with your emotional involvement;
> - They supply both a very powerful *emotional* and an *intellectual* context;
> - The are relatively *on demand* and *accessible* when you want; and
> - They're ideally things you can revisit over and over and over again, gaining inspiration and motivation and drive for action.

These are like talismans that bring energy to your work. The emotional and intellectual aspects incentivize your engagement with them (making them rewarding). The repeated engagement means you can get better at them, learn and grow from them.
