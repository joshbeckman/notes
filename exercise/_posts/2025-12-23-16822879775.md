I was feeling stagnant so I went and lifted weights a bit before today’s physical therapy session. Felt good. 

In the session, we focused on my lower body with balancing  and hamstring strength. 

Then I ate lunch and read about Bari Weiss downgrading the reputation of 60 Minutes and I’m looking out the window, wistfully remembering my days in a newsroom and thinking about how hard it must be now.
