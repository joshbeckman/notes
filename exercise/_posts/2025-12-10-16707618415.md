First PT session for my shoulder and heel. Lots of testing and measurements and then some exercises to strengthen the accessory muscles around my glutes. 

We are thinking the shoulder problem is purely the accessory muscles on my scapula that stabilize my rotator cuff. 

We are thinking the Achilles tendonitis is coming from glute weakness and overuse.

Unknown location (probably inside)
