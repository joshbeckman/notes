Got measured again to update my insurer on my progress. Progress on all fronts. 

Apparently my left big toe has 10° fewer degrees of hyper extension than my right toe. Apparently that is used to push off while walking and running, and maybe that’s contributing to my calf and Achilles stress on my left leg (because they have to compensate).  So now I’ll stretch that, too. 

Otherwise, lots of rotator cuff and scapular work today.

Unknown location (probably inside)
