I’m still slightly sick and it’s been weeks so this morning I get on my first telehealth call (only had to wait like 2 minutes) for a 5 minute chat with some doctor in another state (country?) who was clearly on their porch to get an antibiotic prescription which I then picked up an hour later down the street at the pharmacy. What a time to be alive. 

So I took it a bit easier tonight. Enjoyed listening to [Stream Planet Perfecto 763 by Paul Oakenfold](https://m.soundcloud.com/pauloakenfold/planet-perfecto-763-ft-paul-oakenfold) though.
