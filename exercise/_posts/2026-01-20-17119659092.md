My thumb has been recovering: I can put on shoes with it again. It’s still sore underneath but I think it’s moved in the right direction. 

My shoulder is also better than when I started this series. 

But my right heel hasn’t been better. And just last night I think my left heel might also have started down the same injurious path? So I’m going to make a podiatrist appointment next to see if there’s something more to do.

Unknown location (probably inside)
