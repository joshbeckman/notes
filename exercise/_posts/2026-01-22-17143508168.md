My thumb is mostly under control now, so we’re dropping those exercises in our sessions and I’ll continue on my own. 

My right should is a lot better but I still had some knots in my rotator cuff so today they dry-needled my [teres minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teres_minor_muscle) and teres major muscles to loosen the knots and alleviate the referred pain from there to my deltoid. It took five minutes, there was a deep soreness, and my muscles twitched lightly with relief. Now I drink a lot of water and keep it moving the rest of the day. 

Now we’re just working on my Achilles tendinitis in our sessions: lots of calf and lower body strengthening. My heel inserts for my shoes that I bought yesterday are helping I think.
