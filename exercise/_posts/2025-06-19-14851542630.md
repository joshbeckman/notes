Clarendon Park was taken by classes so Ned and I had to go down to Waveland and wait in line for 40min but it was worth it to play in perfect weather and feel the swing again. Had to leave the court a bit early to make the Cubs game (we got on the Jumbotron!) but I still got a tan/sunburn.

Unknown location (probably inside)
