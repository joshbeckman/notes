Listening to [Understanding and wielding power in local government, with Daniel Golliher](https://www.complexsystemspodcast.com/episodes/understanding-and-wielding-power-in-local-government-with-daniel-golliher/) and still sore from yesterday but getting through it while learning.

My chest was super sore during this, felt it on every movement. Also, my legs are sore still from the deadlifts.

Unknown location (probably inside)
