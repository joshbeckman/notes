![Morning Basketball](/assets/images/kO5bNh5LNsNYUYCEcXRAwiIrGAGRvKOlopgEHjMJAVI-2048x1536.jpg.jpeg)

I hit some threes and made some layups. Not perfect but we won some, at Brands Park.

I'm still running the fastest/most out of anyone on the court - also missing a bunch of shots. I also missed some passes today; I think due to a slippery sweaty ball. Wes says I need to cut in more to guarantee a pass when I dive down to the baseline on a run.

Unknown location (probably inside)
