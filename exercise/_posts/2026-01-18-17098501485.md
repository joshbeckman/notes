![Running on the Treadmill Between Baby Naps](/assets/images/5PY7M83a-MZEqf4kOpDPxgfiEqoRpBjYHwCAOsebGW0-2048x1535.jpg.jpeg)

Everything happens in two hour increments now, so this is a quick treadmill run while the snow softly starts outside and the baby is asleep. 

Wildly, the treadmill’s little video-of-where-you-wish-you-could-be-running-instead-of-inside was showing Darwin Falls - [a hike from Death Valley that John and I actually hiked](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/traveling/after-traveling-death-valley#:~:text=at%20the%20park:-,Darwin%20Falls,-.%20Early%20enough%2C%20we)! And it was one of my favorites, including a waterfall in the desert!

Unknown location (probably inside)
