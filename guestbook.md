At our home, we have a guestbook in the guest room. It’s a fun way to see who has visited and when.

In the same way, it’s so fun to leave a mark on another person’s website, a subtle reminder that you were there, with friends.

And so, if you want to leave your mark on my online home, please do so below.

<div id="cusdis_thread" data-host="https://cusdis.com" data-app-id="0bbb76b5-e971-4d9c-8fa7-a4c9e1ff0984" data-page-id="{{ page.url }}" data-page-url="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}" data-page-title="{{ page.title }}"></div>
