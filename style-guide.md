I kinda wanted to start from [Tom Sachs's COLOR Hex Codes](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/tom-sachs-colors) but I like my colors a bit more exciting than his. Mostly because I work more in a digital medium where bright colors are more common.

Then I started pulling together other aspects of my site that I wanted to document. I've been working on this site for a while now and I've got a lot of customizations that I've made. I wanted to document them so that I could remember them and so that I could share them with others as a reference when I build new sites.

This is style guidance (colors, typography, buttons, forms, etc.). For a demonstration of these styles in action, see [the test post/page](/blog/test).

## Colors

This is the default palette. Often, I'll use these colors as a starting point and then adjust them to fit the requirements of the interface.

| White | Benjamin Moore's Decorator's White | `#EBEDEA` | ![white](https://www.thecolorapi.com/id?format=svg&named=false&hex=ebedea) |

## Typography

Fonts were [originally explained here](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/my-favorite-fonts), but to repeat:
- [IBM Plex Sans](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) for body text
- [IBM Plex Sans Condensed](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) for title text
- [`Berkeley Mono`](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/) for monospace/source-code text

## Buttons/Forms

Whenever possible, use the basic browser implementation of buttons, inputs, links, details, etc. This is because the browser has already done a lot of work to make these elements accessible and usable. If you need to customize these elements, do so with caution and with a lot of testing and justification.
