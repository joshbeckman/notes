This page generates a random "insight" from all my posts - you can [read about how it works](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/using-an-llmand-rag-to-wring-insights-from-my-posts).

Each time you come to this page, it will attempt to generate a new insight. Note that, to prevent abuse, this is currently limited to 10 insights/min (this is across all users: _please share/play nicely_).
