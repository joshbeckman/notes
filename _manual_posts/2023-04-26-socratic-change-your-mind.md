If you’re debating a decision point and you find yourself in a stalemate, one really powerful question to use is “What would cause you to change your mind?”.
This forces the other party to put aside their attempts at convincing you of the merits of their position, and instead puts them in a position where they need to challenge their own perspective.

The act of challenging one's own position may lead to a realization that they were wrong.
Discovering this for one's self is far far more powerful than having someone else try to convince you of a different perspective.
