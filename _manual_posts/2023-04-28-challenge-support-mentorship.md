A great framework for delegating work or encouraging a team member to identify and own new work:

Challenge people to operate at the next level and promise support for them taking on that challenge.

Example: someone says that they are identifying a problem that is a bit of a stretch for them to carve out or solve.
You can identify it as a challenge for them and offer it to them _as a challenge_ that they can accept.
And you should communicate that you will _support_ them taking on that challenge (and how you'll support them).
