I've built a bunch of changes in the last couple weeks.

- bent and attached a hook to hang up my headphones, off the desk when out of meetings
- built a custom wall mount for my monitor, so that it can be higher off the desk (eye-height)
- bought and installed some cheap but pleasing acoustic paneling to reduce echo, for the podcast episodes I've been recording for work

I removed the mounted microphone, as I've been using the headphone-mounted microphone recently (for simplicity). But I'm unsure if I'll stay with the smaller mic, I think it gets in the way when so close to my mouth.

Books on the desk:

- _The Good Citizen_
- _A Pattern Language_
- _The Timeless Way of Building_
- _The Creative Act_
- _Visual Explanations_
