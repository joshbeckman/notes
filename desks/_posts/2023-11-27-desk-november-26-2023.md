I got it in my head that I could make my own, wall\-mounted, smaller desktop and that would give me more comfortable room for my weight rack and workout equipment\. I spent the evening measuring and cutting and assembling a new desktop and then tried it for a couple hours\.

It was too small\. I spent the rest of the evening disassembling it and put the old desk back exactly as it was\.
