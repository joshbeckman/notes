I hung up a towel from San Tropez, France to provide some sound dampening while on work calls, now that I'm trying to close the door more often.

I traded in the iPad for a personal laptop again, and boy does it work exactly the way I want it to work.

To aid in my effort to fix more things around the house _and_ clean up the cabinets, I've started organizing tools on the wall.

And I got a new analog synthesizer that's loads of fun to tune.
