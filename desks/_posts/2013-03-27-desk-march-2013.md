I'm sharing a desk with Bruce at the _Sun-Times_ office, which means we jostle and hunch over our screens all day.

Cups of candy and coffee and cans of soda and the office is thinning out.

I'm shooting more assignments now, which means I'm not always in the office. When I am, Bruce and I are usually passing code back and forth as we add features to one project or another.
