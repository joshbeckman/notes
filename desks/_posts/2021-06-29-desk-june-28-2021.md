I just received a new keyboard - the [Leopold FC660C](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=4097)with Topre switches.

Still using the LED grow light for video calls, a stack of books holding up the camera and laptop as second screen.

Still drinking a full pot of coffee in the morning.
