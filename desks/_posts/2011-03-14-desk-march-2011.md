In Spring of 2011 I'm working as the Photo Editor for _The Daily Illini_ - the student newspaper at the University of Illinois - Urbana/Champaign.

Almost every evening, after classes, I come to this desk with some provisions - tea, fruit - and put together a cohesive photographic product for the next day's edition of the paper and website.
