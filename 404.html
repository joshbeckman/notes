<p>Whatever link brought you here is broken (sorry). Likely, I discarded a note because I didn't think it was true/valuable any more. Possibly, I just moved the page within this site.</p>
<p>Now that you are here, you can either <a href="/tags">browse the index</a> or search to find what you're looking for or <a href="https://www.joshbeckman.org">go to my main site</a> for longer writing and other information.</p>

<p>Do you want for the keywords in the URL you tried to access?</p>

{%- include Search.html -%}
<script>
(function searchVia404() {
  var searchInput = document.getElementById("search-input");
  var search = window.location.pathname.split("/").join(" ").trim().split("-").join(" ");
    // if the window URL contains a hash, use that as the search term
    if (window.location.hash) {
        search = window.location.hash.replace("#", "");
        searchInput.value = search;
        document.getElementById("search-form").submit();
    }
  searchInput.value = search;
})();
</script>
