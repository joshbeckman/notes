<p>Whatever link brought you here is broken (sorry). Likely, I discarded a note because I didn't think it was true/valuable any more. Possibly, I just moved the page within this site.</p>
<p>Now that you are here, you can either <a href="/tags">browse the index</a> or search to find what you're looking for or <a href="https://www.joshbeckman.org">go to my main site</a> for longer writing and other information.</p>

<p>Do you want for the keywords in the URL you tried to access?</p>
