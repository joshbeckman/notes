Hello, friends. I'm [Josh](/about/).

## What I Believe

### On Making

- **Make things. Not too much. Mostly for others** — Our job is to help others. Be of service.
- **Building something means repairing the world around it** — Creation must make the surrounding context more whole. Form, in Context, evaluated against Fit.
- **Publishing is everything** — Nothing matters until it's in use. Shipping is a feature. Publish to replenish.
- **It's not fully shipped until it's fast** — Performance determines whether something is usable.
- **Before making it better, stop making it worse** — Stabilize before optimizing.
- **Work without a vision is toil. Vision without work is a daydream** — Both are necessary. Thinking is work, too.
- **Solve the right problem** — Most failures come from solving the wrong thing well. A well-defined problem is half-solved. Solve for the perimeter, not the area.
- **In software, everything is possible but nothing is free** — Many things in life can't be done, but software is an ultimate enabler.

### On Craft and Flow

- **Do it right, or you'll need to do it over** — Debt and investment compound faster than you think. Half measures are as bad as nothing at all.
- **One change makes seven** — Everything is connected; plan accordingly. Favor focus over features. Adding anything dilutes everything else.
- **Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast** — Rushing creates more problems than it solves. Non-blocking is better than blocking.
- **Approachable is better than simple** — Easy to start with beats theoretically pure. Practicality beats purity.
- **Resource constraints enable creativity; bureaucratic constraints destroy it** — Know which constraints to embrace. With enough workarounds you develop style.

### On People, Communication, and Leadership

- **Mind your words, they are important** — Language shapes thought and culture. Speak like a human.
- **People act on the stories they know** — People do things for reasons. Narrative drives behavior more than facts. Everyone has an incomplete view, but we form complete narratives.
- **Collaboration through communication** — Work in public. Shared understanding enables shared success. Send messages instead of sharing direct control.
- **Ask for help with gratitude** — We have the power to help each other; be in collaboration with the world.
- **Writing stuff down gives you unreasonable influence** — Documentation shapes reality. Writing is thinking.
- **"Just" and "easy" are four letter words** — Respect the complexity others face.
- **Trust accumulates in a "trust battery"** — Every interaction charges or depletes trust.
- **Peace of mind produces right values, right thoughts, right actions** — Inner state manifests outward.
- **Lead through ambiguity, advocate through disagreement** — Embrace uncertainty and differing opinions to find the best path forward.
- **Mental models from diverse disciplines beat narrow expertise** — Cross-functional thinking creates better solutions.

### On Growth and Learning

- **Personal growth has no speed limit** — Keep your identity as small as possible. Growth mindset beats fixed mindset every time.
- **Some lessons aren't worth learning** — Choose empowering beliefs over limiting ones, even if those limits are sometimes true.
- **Mood follows action expresses mood** — Being enthusiastic is worth 25 IQ points. If you can't get out of it, get into it. Pleasure in the job puts perfection in the work.
- **Compete with yourself and root for everyone else** — Success and failure aren't zero-sum.

### On Life Philosophy

- **Go places. Not too much. Mostly self-powered** — You must meet the world to appreciate it and help it.
- **Working on human thriving is the entire point** — Technology serves humanity, not vice versa.
- **Anything you do not give freely becomes lost to you** — Generosity creates abundance.
- **Life is a gift meant to be given away** — We mature by finding worthy causes for our time and energy. Parenting is one long gifting of your rights into another.
- **The only thing you can truly control is your own brain** — Focus energy where you have agency. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.
- **Things come and go in seasons** — You don't have to embrace your current season, but recognizing it gives you control.
