# Josh's Notes

[This site](https://notes.joshbeckman.org) is an export and reformatting of my highlights and notes of my online (and some offline) reading ([script here](https://github.com/joshbeckman/notes/blob/master/utilities/import)).

I use it to jostle loose ideas when I'm researching a particular problem in software design or writing topic. I usually either ask it for a random note or search by keyword.

The site theme is forked from [Simply Jekyll](https://github.com/raghudotcc/simply-jekyll).
