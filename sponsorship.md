In addition to writing and sharing tools on this site, I maintain many open-source software projects. I welcome any issues or ideas you may open there and _especially_ any code you can contribute. Creating and _maintaining_ open-source software and open writing takes a lot of time and money, so fund my software maintenance and writing [via GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/joshbeckman).

## Why Sponsor?

Your sponsorship helps me:

- Maintain and improve open-source projects
- Continue writing and publishing
- Dedicate time to community contributions

## How to Sponsor

The easiest way to support my work is through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/joshbeckman). GitHub Sponsors allows you to set up recurring monthly contributions or make one-time donations.
