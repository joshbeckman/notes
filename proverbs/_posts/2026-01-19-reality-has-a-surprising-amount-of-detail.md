This is taken from the seminal blog post [Reality has a surprising amount of detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail) and it is an eternal truth. 

Your dreams will always run up against the edges and analog curves of reality. The key is to avoid fooling yourself into believing you can avoid the details of reality with a perfect idea, and enjoy the challenge the details present.
