I liked it, but it was pretty strange\!

Itâ€™s a *good* human drama, about a man overcoming his personal fears and anguish and self\-loathing over years and years, with about half an hour of Godzilla fighting as punctuation marks\.

Brandon fell asleep and snored during one of the more tense, quiet parts and that was hilarious\.
