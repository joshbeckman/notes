If you did something, you did it for money, or because it would lead to money. Sure, you still don’t charge your kids for dinner, but you also don’t encourage your kids to sweep up at the supermarket for free. Why should they? It’s someone’s job.
Example: I’m going downtown by cab from the airport. There are forty fellow travelers in the cab line. If I call out, “Anyone want to share a cab to the Marriott?” people look at me funny. They don’t want to owe me for the ride, don’t want to interact, don’t want to open themselves up to the connection that will occur from taking my gift of a ride. They’d rather pay for it, clean and square, and stay isolated. It’s hard to imagine two Bedouin tribespeople isolating from each other with such enthusiasm.
