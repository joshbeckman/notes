This site is my way of [working in the open](https://www.joshbeckman.org/opening-up-my-highlights-notes/) - a public repository of my knowledge, research, and writing that serves both as a personal memory aid and a resource I share with others.

### [Notes](/notes)

My primary knowledge collection, imported from [Readwise/Reader](https://readwise.io/read) highlights of online content and physical book reading, plus manual notes from conversations with peers. I use these as supporting research for my writing and as a memory aid for my work.

### [Blog](/blog)

All of my original writing, including essays, personal life stories, travel writing, and reviews of concerts, movies, and music.

### [Exercise](/exercise)

My exercise log from recent years, which I use to reflect on my health and explore my environment.

### [Replies](/replies)

Cross-posted replies I make on social networks and other external sites, archived here for completeness and reference.

### Pages

Various personal projects and reference content (social accounts, newsletter signup, etc.).

### Tools

I also build lots and lots of tools to help me make the most of my writing and knowledge collection.

## How I Use It

I regularly review my posts to discover new connections and add links between them. The dense interlinking and backlink display creates a cross-pollination effect that helps surface related ideas. I don't have a rigid research-to-writing workflow, but the site helps me identify patterns and develop new ideas over time.

For syndication, I follow [specific rules](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/rules-for-syndication-on-my-site) to ensure content works well both on my site and on external platforms without losing context.

## Features

Posts and pages and notes can link to each other, and backlinks are shown when present.
This allows for two-way linking of ideas.

Search (on the homepage and on a [dedicated page](/search)) allows you to find anything without having to use an external search engine.

Pages and posts support table-of-contents rendering, metadata about citation/sourcing, Readwise integration, `h-card` markup (for webmention support), and more.

## Infrastructure

The site theme was originally forked from [Simply Jekyll](https://github.com/raghudotcc/simply-jekyll) and has slowly been rewritten and refactored over time.

This site's source code lives on [[Github::https://github.com/joshbeckman/notes]] and is served using GitHub Pages.

This website is statically generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) from a set of Markdown files.

Search is powered by [lunrjs](https://lunrjs.com).

Photo galleries and zoom are powered by [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com).

The site fonts are [IBM Plex](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) and [Berkeley Mono](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/).

Network graph views are powered by [vis-network](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/building-a-network-graph-site-index).

Popularity is tracked by [Goatcounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) - public stats are available at [/analytics](https://www.joshbeckman.org/analytics).

Guestbook comments are powered by [Cusdis](https://cusdis.com/).

Serverless scripts (e.g. for [generating insights](/insight)) are hosted/run by [Val Town](https://www.val.town).

You can read about everything else I use to build things at [/uses](/uses).
