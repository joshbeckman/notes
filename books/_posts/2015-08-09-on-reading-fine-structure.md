I’ve sent these thoughts & instructions to friends more than once, so I should probably write them down.

From my [Reading Lists]( /lists/reading), [Fine Structure](http://qntm.org/structure) _Sam Hughes_

This is the content of my latest email recommendation for this series/book/collection-of-blog-posts.

This is the science fiction I was talking about during Friday’s party. It is about super heroes, hard science, time travel, universal scale and storytelling devices. I love it - read it three times.

I have some suggestions on _how_ to read Fine Structure.

The first time reading it, do so without reading _any_ comments. Trust me, there are pieces of information you will regret reading if you do so during your first pass. Upon a second reading of the series, your _really_ should read the comments, as there is a great deal of thought process revealed by the writer in there.

My one request is that, if you do start reading it, you tell me. I would love to hear your thoughts! I’ll give mine.

Ah, and the author has written other science fictions (smaller than this series) at [qntm.org/fiction](//qntm.org/fiction) if you like this.
