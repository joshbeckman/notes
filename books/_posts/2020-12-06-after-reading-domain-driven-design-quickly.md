I read this on recommendation from other people at Shopify. The concepts were good, and I highlighted several sentences, but the text was heavy with jargon.

I was a bit familiar with the concepts of DDD already, but this expanded with helpful examples and additional branches.

At least it was a quick read, and will be good as a reference text.
