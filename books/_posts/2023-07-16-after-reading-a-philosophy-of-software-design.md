I had been recommended this book a handful of times by coworkers at Shopify, so I finally ordered it, hoping that I would find it as valuable as those others.

I started and finished it this morning, highlighted a few key sentences and diagrams, but ultimately felt that it was a bit late for me to be reading this book. I think I absolutely would have found it more useful and pithy had I encountered this earlier in my career, when I hadn't found the technique laid out in the book through my own experiences (and scars).

This isn't to say the book isn't good: I would certainly recommend this to someone who is junior enough to have not learned these trade-offs yet; someone who would find the passages connecting dots between their learning and their aspirations.
