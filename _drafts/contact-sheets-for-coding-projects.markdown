title: Contact Sheets for Coding Projects
---

One of my favorite photography books is [Magnum Contact Sheets](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/magnum-contact-sheets-kristen-lubben/1100871555). It shows the contact sheets (full rolls of developed film) for the moments surrounding famous photographs in the Magnum catalog.

The raw thought process alongside serendipity you can learn from watching the worked sequence and editing applied to the original content is something I bring to my own photography and I find seeping into my reading of many other creative projects. I appreciate and seek out the editing thought process shown by Craig Mod and Van Neistat - creators who bring the evolution of their project into the final product itself.

I wish there were more of this for software and code-based projects. I want to know the wrong turns and half-implementations of exemplary libraries like ActiveRecord, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Kafka, etc. The closest I've gotten to this (and it's pretty close) is just by watching the evolution of these projects over time, with their progressive features and releases. The most generous authors - think [the &nbsp;author of Redis](http://antirez.com/latest/0) - explain their reasoning as they release new features.

But even in these histories, the authors are largely only showing the successful pathways. I want to see the half-implemented features that were eventually discarded. I think the place to start looking for these coding contact sheets is in the version control (git) history for the projects, but that is highly subjective based on the author's committing style.
