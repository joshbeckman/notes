title: Commenting Through Webmentions
---

[Webmentions](https://webmention.net) are a way to notify sources that you linked back to them, optionally with authorship and comments attached.

- Mark up posts with [h-entry](https://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry)
- Use [xRay](https://xray.p3k.app) to test the h-entry markup
- [Example note parsing](https://xray.p3k.app/parse?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnotes.joshbeckman.org%2Fnotes%2F486391566&pretty=true)
- [Example essay parsing](https://xray.p3k.app/parse?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.joshbeckman.org%2Fwho-and-why-and-how-im-funding%2F&pretty=true)
- Send webmentions through [a client implementation](https://webmention.net/implementations/)
- Receive webmentions through [webmention.io](https://webmention.io)
- Display webmentions with some JavaScript and CSS
