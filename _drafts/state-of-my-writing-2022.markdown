title: 'State of My Writing: 2022'
---

I started 2022 by setting up this website on [ghost.org](https://ghost.org). I paid the annual fee to host the webiste and newsletter, and I planned to write more. I planned to share more with my family (through a special sectoin of the newsletter) and to share more writing in general with the tech community.

I think I can count 2022 as a failure in both of those respects. I did write [a popular post]( __GHOST_URL__ /what-spam-accounts-look-like-in-2022/) in February, but have hardly written a public topic since that post.

In personal writing, I've started a couple of satisfying series (a [media log]( __GHOST_URL__ /tag/media-log/) and a [desk series]( __GHOST_URL__ /tag/desk/)). I started to catalog [a bit of travel]( __GHOST_URL__ /tag/travel/), but haven't included as much as I should (I haven't posted, for example, about our biggest trip of the year). I haven't written general personal updates or things that I would have thought to share with friends and family. And I've not sent actual newsletters to family - thinking that these personal musings were to drab to share even with close friends. (But I'm posting them publicly online? How does that make any sense?)

I've been taking all my notes by hand for the last 6 months. Of course, I take work notes digitally - the whole point is to share those with other people and they only contain work-owned concepts. My personal notes happening on paper has solidified a disconnect between my day-to-day tasks and random thoughts and longer form thinking (like this post). Should I be embracing this or removing this distinction?
