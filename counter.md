This is a page that displays the life of my counter.

You can choose to grow the counter or you can destroy it.

<div id="counter">?</div>

<button id="grow">Grow</button>
<button id="kill">Kill</button>

If it's more than zero, it's because others before you helped it grow. If it's very big, it's because many have cared for it a lot.

This is *my* counter because it lives with me. The number here is the same as the number on the physical flap-display counter in my home.

<script async src="/assets/js/counter.js"></script>
