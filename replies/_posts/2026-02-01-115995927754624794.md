<p><span class="h-card" translate="no"><a href="https://indieweb.social/@tg" class="u-url mention">@<span>tg</span></a></span> this was a beautiful read this morning as I rocked my baby to sleep. I would live to test the river you&#39;re building. Currently I use Readwise’s Reader for all RSS and social posting. I would live to see what a contextual stream interface could be. Maybe with little eddies of writers on similar topics, ways to find things other than by time.</p>
