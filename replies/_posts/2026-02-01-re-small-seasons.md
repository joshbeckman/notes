I really loved reading [On Small Seasons and Long Calendars](https://rosszurowski.com/log/2018/small-seasons-long-calendars) this morning. I felt so vindicated! (Seasonality is [one of my guiding beliefs](https://www.joshbeckman.org/#:~:text=Things%20come%20and%20go%20in%20seasons).) I second the idea that midwestern winters+summers impose a strong seasonality on local life! A favorite of mine in Chicago is [Ice Watch](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/478410758).

Another good example of seasonality-as-guide is my favorite cookbook: [Six Seasons by Joshua McFadden](https://www.joshuamcfadden.com/projects/six-seasons) ([notes](https://www.joshbeckman.org/search/?q=%2722465999&keys=book)). Whenever I'm tired of the same old food I'll find the current season in there and the flavors are guaranteed to be good.

Two years ago I [built little seasons](https://github.com/joshbeckman/notes/blob/74e985c02add2f60e726a85dd61864fe8b0cca83/_data/seasons.yml#L1) [into my](https://github.com/joshbeckman/notes/blob/74e985c02add2f60e726a85dd61864fe8b0cca83/index.md?plain=1#L62-L63) site's [pages](https://www.joshbeckman.org/humans.txt) and this is inspiring me to make them more prominent and specific to me. I'm *definitely* taking [_sekki_ Small Seasons](https://smallseasons.guide/) as a new starting point (I love the small site concept and subscribed to the calendar - I always want [more things in my calendar](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/everywhere-a-calendar)).
