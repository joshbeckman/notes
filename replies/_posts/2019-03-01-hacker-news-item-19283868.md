<p>If anyone's interested in this space/solution, we've been running Narro (<a href="https://www.narro.co" rel="nofollow">https://www.narro.co</a>) along the same lines (with a TON of integrations now) for years. It also supports dozens of languages/voices, PDFs, ebooks, videos, publisher analytics, yadda yadda yadda</p>
