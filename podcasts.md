## Personal
I've recently started publishing my music explorations in a podcast called Josh Songs. Subscribe [via iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/josh-songs/id1689956820), via [raw podcast RSS/feed URL](https://songs.joshbeckman.org/podcast/index.rss), or browse the code I use to generate it. 

## Work
I contribute to the Shift internal engineering podcast at Shopify. You can only subscribe to that if you're a Shopify employee!
