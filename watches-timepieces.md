## Want

In order of ascending price

- [Islander Port Jefferson Skin Diver Automatic Watch with White Dial #ISL-176](https://longislandwatch.com/islander-port-jefferson-skin-diver-automatic-watch-with-white-dial-isl-176/)
  - This is a super colorful skin-diver for under $500
- [Nodus Sector Deep - Flare Destro](https://www.noduswatches.com/sector-deep/p/sector-deep-flare-destro)
  - This is a vibrant and heartily-spec'd dive watch with incredible legibility and utility for under $600
- [Rivanera in White or Gray from echo/neutra](https://echoneutra.com/products/rivanera-white)
  - This is a lovely rectangle case dress watch, art-deco inspired
- [Squale 1521 Classic](https://www.squale.ch/en/1521-classic-cosc-bracelet)
  - This is a COSC under $2k, like a super-upgraded SKX
  - Also consider [the ocean blue version](https://www.squale.ch/en/1521-ocean-cosc-bracelet)
- [Seconde Française 19.24 in Anthracite Gray from Beaubleu](https://beaubleu-paris.com/en/products/seconde-francaise-anthracite-gray?variant=48619363107092)
  - This is an amazing thing to look at, with a floating seconds hand

  - This is a COSC for under $3k with a very modern, super-lume aesthetic. I just kind feel like all that plastic lume looks plastic-y

  - The cheaper version of this is the [Baltic Aquascaphe Classic](https://baltic-watches.com/en/products/aquascaphe-blue-gilt?variant=17494500835399)

## Appreciate But Probably Wouldn't Like

These are the designs that I adore but I probably wouldn't like them in practice.

- [Farer Integra Perlarum](https://usd.farer.com/products/perlarum)
  - This is just a beautifully detailed dial, though I probably wouldn't wear it enough to justify it
- [Doxa SUB 300T Searambler](https://doxawatches.com/products/sub-300t-searambler) (or 300 Professional)
  - I think I would want more lume (especially on the bezel) than this affords
- Appreciate the story but don't want: [Marathon GSAR Diver's](https://wornandwound.com/video-enthusiast-spotlight-contemplations-on-time-with-van-neistat-and-the-marathon-gsar-divers-automatic/)
  - Generally I think this is overpriced and I would hate seeing the tritium glow fading over the years while all my luminova watches continue lighting up
