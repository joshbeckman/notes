An end to a wonderful day of [tennis and baseball](https://www.joshbeckman.org/exercise/14851542630) with Ned as we rode the Blue Line north to meet Grant at one of my favorite venues: Sleeping Village. The atmosphere is always supportive and the bar is good and the venue is tight and every spot has a good view.

The opener was [_Gift_](https://www.gift-music.com/) and their psychedelic pop/shoegaze sound reminded me of Black Sabbath and I enjoyed it. The stage was busy: 3 guitarists and two of them also played synth but the notes hit. Their bassist was so smiley throughout.

[_Sunflower Bean_](https://www.sunflowerbeanband.com/) was well assembled - at only three members - and they were well practiced. Best stage fan placement _ever_ - her hair would flicker only a bit and only when she was at the mic. The guitarist kept getting his guitar hookup mussed and noisy and kept unplugging and plugging back in but they stayed upbeat through it all.
