Marybeth and I went with Bill, Emily, Kate, Shannon, Kylie, Grant, and Eddie\.
Grant and Eddie left only a bit into the concert\.

This was my first time attending a show at Chop Shop.
But the venue was super chill and small, the show was really good \(though I forgot my earplugs again and my ears are still ringing\)\.
And the whole evening was just lovely \- went to Tapster afterward, then back to Bemilyâ€™s house\.
