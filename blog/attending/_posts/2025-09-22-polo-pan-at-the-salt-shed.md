[Polo & Pan](https://poloandpan.komi.io/) came to the Salt Shed for our friend Paul's birthday and brought [Tycho](https://tychomusic.com/) along as an opener. We ate and played at bit at [Elston Electric](https://www.elstonelectric.com/) beforehand, but soon moved out into the sunset to enjoy the music.

I had always wanted to see Tycho from his first album years ago but never got the chance. I'm glad we got that treat last night - the heavy bass and rolling melodies felt great.

But the headliners stole the show, of course. They took us on a journey through earth and sea and into space to land on the moon.

Their lighting rig on stage was pretty and pretty involved: a full-width curved LED panel with pass-through to light panels behind it, along with a moving drop-ceiling panel the width of their synth podium. The effect was mesmerizing and made us all feel like they were floating us through space.
