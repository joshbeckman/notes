I hadn't seen BMSR before but everyone else had and so I didn't know the treat I was in for.

They draped a big net in front of the stage so they could have two projectors in tandem - one on the screen behind them and on on the netting in front - project different scenes, so it seemed as if they were surrounded by moving images. And the images showed teeth turning into faces and singing the lyrics. It was perfect industrial psychedelic chic, straight outta Pittsburgh.
