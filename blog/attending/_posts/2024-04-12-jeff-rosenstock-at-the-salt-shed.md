Sidney Gish opened for the show and said, “let’s go guys” before starting each song, looping different sounds from her guitar and assembling them into a full ensemble over and over again\. It was sublime\.

Jeff Rosenstock took the stage to a cover of *Chop Suey\!* and then addressed the mosh pit already forming\. The rest of the show was pure energy and emotion screamed into the crowd\. He had to shake his spit out of the mic multiple times during the set and every song went immediately into the next, changing tempo and tone effortlessly\. There was someone crowd\-surfing constantly and everyone was happy\.
