We went with a large group and met still more friends out at West Fest to eat and drink and bob along with Deeper. They were good but the crowd was loud - I preferred [last yearâ€™s fest](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/attending/grapetooth-at-west-fest) a bit more. Afterward we walked up to Queen Mary and enjoyed some fancy cocktails while it rained.
