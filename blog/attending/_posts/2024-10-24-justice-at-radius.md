I've loved _Justice_'s music since we would listen to their debut album on the long drive between Chicago and University of Illinois and yell, "Justice!" as we passed the blazingly-lit Effingham cross on the night highway.

One Lollapalooza, I didn't buy a ticket but instead sat in the park behind their stage to listen to them play, as I got eaten alive by mosquitoes and swore I would go to their next concert in Chicago.

This show was _amazing_. They played the hits - everything I had hoped for - and the lighting rig was mesmerizingly intense. No notes.
