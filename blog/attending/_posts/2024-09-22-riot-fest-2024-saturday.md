We went along with friends to [Riot Fest](https://riotfest.org/chicago/lineup/) on Saturday. It was previously farther outside the city but this year they moved it back to Douglas Park inside the city and we have to encourage that.

## Clutch

I didn't know them but Laura did and that was good enough for me.

## Beach Bunny

I've really enjoyed every album of theirs and seeing them in person with three mosh pits going in front of their happy energy was lovely.

## St. Vincent

I was most excited to see her and it was a sublime mix of fanfare and voice and bass.

## Beck

I didn't know what to expect but I did not expect to enjoy his show so much.
