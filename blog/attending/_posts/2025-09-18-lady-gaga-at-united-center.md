It's a good thing there's a stage as big as this to hold [Lady Gaga](https://www.ladygaga.com/us-en/)'s drama. She _needs_ (and deserves) a _lot_ of attention.

Every seat was filled but everyone was standing (we were in section 109 on generosity from a friend, who then got sick and had to drop so we gave some generosity to more friends). I've never seen so many skulls at a concert. Lady Gaga's heavy breathing into the microphone after every dance number connected us and will live in my memory.
