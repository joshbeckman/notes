I had never been to see Tame Impala before but had only heard good things and so I went with friends to watch the most colorful rainbow light show I've ever seen.

The music was lovely but I felt a bit let down by Kevin Parker's voice; I heard enough cracks in his falsetto lyrics for it to be distracting. I'm sure he was sick or recovering from something.

We were surprised by how young the crowd seemed, given we started listening to Tame Impala in college. We were seated near a landing with a great view, so we were treated to a parade of Instagram influencer wannabes that took faux photos in front of us.
