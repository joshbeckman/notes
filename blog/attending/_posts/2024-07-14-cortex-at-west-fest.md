I walked over to the last evening of West Fest in sickly humid heat. I grabbed food from one of the vendors and ate as the crowd filled in. A crowd with old jazz heads and twenty-something body modders and a dude selling beer from his cooler bag and puppies and kids with headphones. And me and Ned.

Ned had tipped me off to Cortex a few months earlier and it was serendipitous that they were coming to town. Their most famous album is heavily sampled in hip-hop, but their plain songs are delightful bops with good bass lines. 

They ran past curfew cutoff and the cops had to go on stage to get these old French jazz pianists to stop playing. Good summer fun.
