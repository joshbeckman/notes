I've seen [Zeds Dead](https://www.zedsdead.net/) many times now and still they do not disappoint. There's just something undeniably fun and healing to be in a room with other people and feel the air be pushed around you, throbbing with bass, until you're all moving together as one mass.

[Apashe](https://www.apashemusic.com/) is a drama fiend, playing hallucinated videos of medieval sci-fi. I would love to see him play with an orchestra.

On the way home, I walked to the Chinatown Red Line stop and nearly lost my ears in the bitterly frozen wind.
