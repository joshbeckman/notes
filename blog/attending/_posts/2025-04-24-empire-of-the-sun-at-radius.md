They assembled a stage fit for an intergalactic emperor. They brought the amazing [dancers from PNAU](https://music.apple.com/us/music-video/solid-gold-feat-kira-divine-marques-toliver/1459335507). (Seriously, these were the best backup dancers I've seen since Big Freedia or Big Dipper. Unquestionably the best backup dancer _outfits_.) Behind them, they had 3D projections of inner electronics and outer space, the doors of perception opening and closing through their choreography. And so a sold out crowd at the huge venue sang along to all the hits and left walking on a dream.
