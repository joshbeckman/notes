It's a very Chicago thing to spend the last Saturday of February standing out in the cold in a street music festival to dance along with punk and hard pop and synth bands. But we love [Music Frozen Dancing](https://www.musicfrozendancing.com/) every year.

The Empty Bottle ([previously](https://www.joshbeckman.org/search/?q=%27%22empty%20bottle%22)) puts on the free music festival every year and every year I go with friends and and every year someone takes a photo from the next door building and every year we give them the finger and every year I get so cold I almost want to leave and every year I find new bands that I listen to on repeat.

Oh and also every year Ned has us over for coffee and a cocktail before we head out into the cold and it sets the tone just right.

This year's lineup:

## Clickbait

Definitely some of the best costumes I've _ever_ seen - at a show of any size: human-sized eyes, a mouth with cigarette, and a nose with boogers. Fun bops, but kinda sound all the same.

## Double Over

Only played a couple songs for some reason?

## Landowner

This was a new find for me and I liked their East-Coast punk synth rock. The lead singer kept my attention.

## Bib

Good, standard punk rock with some good instrumentalists on that stage.

## Egyptian Lover

I had heard his music before but never seen him live. Damn, it was fine to hear everything groove together with only, like, 4 different tones per song. He had the whole crowd dancing.
