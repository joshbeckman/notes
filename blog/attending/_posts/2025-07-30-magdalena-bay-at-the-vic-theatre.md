I absolutely _adored_ Magdalena Bay's latest album, "Imaginal Disk", so I jumped on a last-minute ticket (with a group of friends) when they were going to perform a sold out pre-Lollapalooza "aftershow".

The line at The Vic was the longest I'd ever seen - around the corner and down the block - before the doors opened, with lots of kids wearing Mica's signature makeup. The show itself was very fun and excitedly theatrical, but I wanted more of Mica's vocals and keyboard in the mix. Many of their songs have both a heavy bass line and a bright upper range, and too often I only heard the bottom half.
