I always love going to Sleeping Village and so when I saw Jessy Lanza (who I have [really enjoyed in the past](/blog/attending/caribou-and-jessy-lanza)) was going to be there, I grabbed tickets for a group of us\. It was a great show\.

The opener, Golden Donna, was new to me but I really liked his set\. He got *so* into his performance that he sweat all the way through his shirt, but the crowd was on his side\.

This was apparently the last stop on Jessy Lanza’s tour, and it was just her and one other guitarist/drummer on stage \(usually I’ve seen her just by herself\)\. It was a great set, and just before ending she introduced her bandmate \- it was her younger sister who was on tour for her first time\! And it was so lovely because her sister kept mouthing the words to all the songs and they were clearly so happy to be playing together\.
