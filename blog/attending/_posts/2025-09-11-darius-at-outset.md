Scenes from the [Darius](https://www.francerocks.com/artist/darius/) show:
- at one point, someone dancing in the front row takes a FaceTime call and gives their phone to Darius who takes it up on stage and waves to the caller
- later, another person gives him their phone and he takes a video touring the stage and the crowd
- he gets on the mic multiple times to thank the crowd in a lovely thick French accent
- he played in on the controls as [Jayah](https://www.instagram.com/jayahhasson/?hl=en) (the opener, who I'm now realizing I'd seen previously at [The Weekender](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/attending/jungle-and-drama-at-the-july-fourth-weekender)) ended her set - seamless sound transition
- the whole audience singing along with _CHERIE_

I'm so glad I jumped at the chance to see this show. Darius had a great album out in 2022 that I've had in rotation so I was excited to see him live. He didn't disappoint, and his new music from the set is making me look forward to the next album.

This was my first concert at [Outset](https://outsetlive.com/), even though it's within walking distance and I've bought tickets for shows there in the past. It's just that those shows got moved to Concord (sister theater) at the last minute ([previously](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/attending/bonobo-at-concord)). Well, this time I bought a ticket to a show at Concord and it was moved last minute to Outset - a happy surprise.
