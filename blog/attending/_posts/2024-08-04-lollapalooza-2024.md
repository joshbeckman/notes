It's always packed and young and hot and fun. Riding the L home we overheard a group of girls talk about how upset they were that tomorrow they have to clean their room.


## Saturday

### Kenny Beats
Good stuff.

### Nia Archives
Good stuff. More up-tempo than her albums.

### Four Tet
Heavy bass and a bit more acid than his usual. I've been listening to a lot of interviews with him recently, and he fits his sets to the specific festival - it showed. I love seeing him happy while performing.

### Skrillex
We had _really_ been looking forward to this after so many years. Worth it.

## Sunday

### Vince Staples
I loved seeing him years ago at Electric Forest, but this time the sound and the energy bled off the stage too much.

### Whyte Fang
Allison Wonderland's second name show was good!

### Black Tiger Sex Machine
I always love seeing them tear up a stage.

### Zeds Dead
I've seen them so many times and yet each one leaves me happy and hopeful and head-bangin'.

### Blink-182
Less energetic than the first time I saw them, but they love the crowd and the crowd loves them and the music is good.
