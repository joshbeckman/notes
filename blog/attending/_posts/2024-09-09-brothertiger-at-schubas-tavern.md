Paul recommended Brothertiger to us and was very excited to see him play. We didn't know him but we'll trust Paul's excitement. I like shows at Scuba's because they're small and the crowd is usually enthusiastic.

I've never been to a show with such a high ratio of lasers to people in the room. It might have been overwhelming, but it was paired with  chill, synth wave music that made the crowd sway and ooh and ahh as the colors changed. It felt like a warm bath of music and light.
