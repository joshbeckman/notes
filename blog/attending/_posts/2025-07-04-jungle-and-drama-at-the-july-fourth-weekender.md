The organizers of [The July Fourth Weekender](https://www.frontgatetickets.com/events/the-july-fourth-weekender) (Front Gate Tickets) had us worried because they didn't release/send the tickets under 4 hours before the gates opened! But they arrived and we arrived at the Lakefront Green (Fullerton and the Lakefront trail).

We came in the catch the end of *Pretty Girl* and she was excitedly playing for a sparse but appreciative crowd. The we got to see a previous favorite of ours - *DJ Boring* - who lead into the first act I was really excited to see: *Todd Terje*. It was incredibly hot in the sun - every sparse cloud cover felt like a drop of ten degrees.

He handed over the stage - which was filling up with VIP members behind the decks - to local favorite *[DRAMA](https://thedramaduo.com/)* who I have loved for many years. I hadn't seen them live since years ago  at some west-side street festival. It was fun to dance to some live vocals.

But then *Jungle* came on and stole the show. The crowd was thick and the fireworks were popping in the distance over the water and they mixed their hits with old soul music and heavy modern bass and _everyone_ was dancing.
