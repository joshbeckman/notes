I have loved **Still Woozy** since he released _Cooks_ in 2017. I remember blasting _Lucy_ in the car ride home from Electric Forest in 2019 over and over and over. Back then he only had like 4 or 5 singles released, but I made a significant mental note to follow him.

He's released a few actual albums since then, and apparently become super popular. I saw that he was coming to Chicago - down the street from me - and got ready for the presale but all the tickets were sold out by the time my number was up. Resale was high, but I still wanted to go. I waited and eventually the price dropped, so I picked up a resale ticket for myself while everyone else was busy for half the original price.

When I showed up, I found out that I had purchased a VIP ticket and so I spent the show on the balcony close to the stage. He started without an opener and only went for a bit over an hour, but, damn, it was a great show. I had not seen so many people singing all the words to most songs in a while. The place was packed. The band was into it. His lead guitarist is talented. She said she's related to him? This crowd is so young. These songs are so good.
