Bill offered me a ticket because someone was sick and couldn't go. It was only $25, a sale from LiveNation earlier in the year to fill seats.

When we arrived I realized that the tickets were for *actual* seats, way in the back of the pavilion. But as we found them, an employee offered us free upgrades to watch from the front pit! So we got to spend the whole show up close - where I've always watched shows at Northerly Island.

Dave Bayley, the lead singer, was *in love* with the crowd. As he caressed the cameras and flirted with the front row, all I could think about was:

> Oooh, the audience loves me... and I love them. And they love me for loving them and I love them for loving me. And we love each other.
&mdash; Roxie, *Chicago*

The music swelled and bopped. And the stage was well done - effervescence and a hologram display. And we all went home elated.
