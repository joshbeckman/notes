For [Shopify's Summit '25](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/traveling/shopify-summit-2025), the company rented out the Budweiser stage again ([previously](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/attending/the-roots-weezer-girl-talk-at-budweiser-stage)). The weather was beautiful again and I got closer to the stage.

Phoenix played a nice set and I remembered how much I liked their music.

But the closer and main act of the night was Steve Aoki. He's had so many hits that you can't help but bop along. His latest isn't my favorite, but he put on a great show and the cake-throwing at the end was absolutely delightful.
