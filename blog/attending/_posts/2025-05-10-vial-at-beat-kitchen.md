I didn't get to see [VIAL](https://www.vialband.com/) when they came to Chicago last year, so I was excited  when they were back on tour this month. On top of that, they were going to be at Beat Kitchen, one of the local venues I hadn't gotten to see. (It's a nice venue - feels like an alternate universe version of Schubas Tavern.)

What a fun, charismatic show. They had the crowd frothing and running and chanting, and they did it with anger and confidence. I was laughing and yelling with them.

There were two Chicago bands that opened for them: Bloom and Sunday Cruise. I really loved Sunday Cruise - they had a lot of great hooks and their lead guitarist was talented and bouncing all over the stage.
