I *most* wanted to see the opener, [Sofia Kourtesis](https://sofiakourtesis.com/), a Peruvian producer, vocalist, and DJ from Berlin. So we got there early enough to see the DJ _before_ her and dance ourselves into a good stage-right spot.

She played _some_ of her own music, but I was slightly disappointed to hear her end the set with _Jump Around_ and _I Wanna Dance With Somebody_ instead of playing more of her bright Latin rhythms. I just wanted _more_ of what I know she has! Maybe I'll have to hold out for her own headliner show, where she's less of a DJ.

After her, [S.G. Lewis](https://www.bigfamily.music/artists/sg-lewis) absolutely made his own stage up there. A wide wall of LED panels with multiple feedback cameras played and looped his 80s-anemoia graphics into colorful and wispy settings. He was wearing a beige suit, playing guitars, singing, and [RAHH](https://www.iamrahh.com/) sang lovely vocals throughout.

We were surprised by the crowd - a mix of raver girls and guys wearing "I'm a good boy" shirts and couples hugging.
