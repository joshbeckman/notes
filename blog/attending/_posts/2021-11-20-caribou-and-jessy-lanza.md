One of the best concerts Iâ€™ve ever been to\. Jessy Lanza was a *fantastic* opener and really captured our attention\. She played a great building set and had quirky visuals of old folks dancing and just completely won over the crowd\.

Caribou played with a full band on the stage and it was *incredibly* loud but just sublime rhythm and melody\. One of my top artists\.

We got to the Riviera _really_ really early so that we would get a good spot on the rail. It was worth it.
