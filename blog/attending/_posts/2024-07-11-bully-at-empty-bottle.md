This show was part of the [Nothing/Assumed series](https://www.wbez.org/culture-the-arts/2024/01/26/chicago-sober-events-the-nothing-assumed-music-series-at-empty-bottle) of sober events for sober artists. I got a great draft N/A cocktail from the bar: cucumber and raspberry shrub, I think.

I got there slightly before the set time and it was already packed. Luckily, I could still get a spot on the platform for myself and Ned and Grant. They started right away - no opener! All Bully, in their longest set ever (she said - there was a lot of cute back-n-forth with the crowd).

The crowd was into it, the band was into the crowd, they played their new stuff, she played the first song she recorded here in Chicago. Really well-rounded show.
