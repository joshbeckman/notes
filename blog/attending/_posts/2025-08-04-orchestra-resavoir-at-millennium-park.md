This was part of the annual [Millennium Park Summer Music Series](https://www.choosechicago.com/articles/festivals-special-events/millennium-park-summer-music-series/), so we went with a picnic blanket's worth of friends and brought cocktails and snacks and desserts and relaxed into the lilting jazz as the sun set and night took over the park.
