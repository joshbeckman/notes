We sat too far back at Concord for my liking, but we still had a grand old time at the Love Ball\.

They had only started rehearsing the show 72h before they performed it for us, and it showed\. Some numbers had to be redone, and some things just didn’t quite line up\.

But who’s gonna complain at a drag show?

And La La Ri, my favorite, of course, was the best performer there\.
