On the first night of Shopify Summit 2024, we were treated to a trio of performances in a privately-opened [Budweiser Stage](https://www.canadianamphitheatre.net/) in Toronto, Canada.

The Roots put on a great opening act - almost a continuous set with brass players on stage. 

Weezer played the hits, and you can't help but love that.

Girl Talk was a surprise and a real throwback to 2008 Josh - I last saw him in a tiny college bar. Still full of iconic tracks.
