This was my fourth time seeing Big Wild ([previously](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/attending/big-wild-at-red-rocks)) and it seemed like the shortest concert; I wanted it to last so much longer.

We originally had floor/GA tickets, but sold them and bought premium balcony-seated tickets at the last minute due to Marybeth's pregnancy. The view and sound from the balcony inside the Shed was perfect.

I'm amazed at how Jackson Stell can start singing the next song in a new key while the previous melody ends. The seamless transition sounds like a wavering bridge that carries us smoothly across.
