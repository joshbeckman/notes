I’ve loved each of his albums, reeling guitar licks and melodies that make you swirl your head. 

I showed up early to get a good spot and it was already packed and sweaty on an 85° night. But I was attending by myself so I was able to stand in the good spot in the back on the platform - always the best view in Empty Bottle. 

The show was so good that I forgot to take a photo until the encore. I was stuck watching him run both his hands up the neck of the guitar to play galloping riffs.
