We got there an hour before the show to get a good view and it was already packed. I’ve seen them several times before this but that’s exactly why I wanted a good spot - because I knew how good it could be with a view. 

There was no opener. A strong stance. 

The show was solid LCD. I only got this basic photo because I was dancing to the rest of every song. Sometimes the show is good enough to make me forget to take photos.
