I got offered an extra ticket to attend this show with some friends, and this was my first time in the seated balcony. We got there early to get a spot right on the rail and the extra effort was worth it. Getting to see the projectionist work throughout the show was an interesting treat.

The highlight of their shows is absolutely Leland Whitty. His encircling and ethereal solos lifted me up. I hope he expands into something like [Colin Stetson](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/attending/colin-stetson-at-bohemian-national-cemetery) as he grows older.
