Sarah Barthel, the lead singer, was definitely still sick after cancelling an earlier stop on the tour. But it was a banger of a show anyway. We went with a whole group and Marybeth made Valentines for everyone.

They played five straight hits to start the show and then stayed there. They flat out owned the syncopated rock genre in the early 2010s, and hearing it at full, enveloping force again was warm and lovely.
