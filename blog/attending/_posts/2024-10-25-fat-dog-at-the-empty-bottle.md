I bought tickets to this show back in June when Bill told me they were coming to Chicago. At the time, the band had only released two songs and I like them, so I bought in.

The week of the show, Bill almost backed out. But we were able to make the timing work. We showed up and turns out that Bill forgot he had bought five tickets, so we had a good laugh about that.

The set was intense. The opener had a mosh pit going halfway through and two drummers and two band members dove off the stage into the crowd. When _Fat Dog_ came on, it was cranked up even higher. The mosh pit stayed and grew, and the electro-rock-polka beats drove things to a fever pitch. Very fun fast show!
