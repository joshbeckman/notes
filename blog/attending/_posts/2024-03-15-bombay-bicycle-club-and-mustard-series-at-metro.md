I implored people to get tickets to their show when it was announced \- their latest album was so good\. We went with Paul and Dan and Walters and Ned bought a last\-minute ticket as well\.

The show was so much fun! They broadened the songs where the crowd could jam out and layered softness with dance music\.

And the opener, Mustard Service, was really fun as well\. They had kind of a groovy surfer rock vibe and get everyone singing before the main act even took the stage\. *And* they came out to play the last song of the night with Bombay Bicycle Club, which I always love\.
