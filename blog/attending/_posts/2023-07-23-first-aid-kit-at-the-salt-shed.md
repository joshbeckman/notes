The Swedish duo's ethereal and intertwined voices harmonizing and melodically moving through the concert hall were amazing to experience.

Truly beautiful singing, a wonderful performance of folk-rock music that resonated the crowd for hours.

And they played out the crowd with ABBA, which created an impromptu dance party, and left us all grinning.
