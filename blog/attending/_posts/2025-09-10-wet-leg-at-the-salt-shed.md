This second time seeing [Wet Leg](https://wetlegband.com/) ([previously](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/attending/wet-leg-at-thalia-hall)) was  bigger in every way. Bigger stage, bigger band, bigger venue, bigger swagger. It's their [Moisturizer](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/listening/moisturizer-by-wet-leg) tour but they played nearly every song off their two albums and still ended before an hour and a half. 

Great fun, though. I loved how heavy metal some of their songs can sound on such a big stage, and even hearing some of their first album songs with the bigger band brought out some new notes that I liked. Rhian Teasdale had the crowd eating out of her hands. Even after the big stage, I would _love_ to see this band at a small venue like Empty Bottle instead.
