I love the Sleeping Village venue. It's a bit of a bike ride to get there, but there's good food nearby and good drinks inside and a relaxed patio atmosphere that make it easy to enjoy. We got a great spot for Marie's show, even with the crowd getting dense after a false start with some broken CDJ equipment.

I was ready to dance hard at the show and feel some bass, but I wasn't ready for her wide eyes and spoken-word lyrics and "Samara from The Ring" hair in the face but I got fully on board by the end. You gotta love when a performer has a clear vision and message. It got sweaty, and she joined the crowd in the pit for her encore and walked out through the front door.

We left the venue into a downpour of rain, and ran over to Mother's Ruin for a drink to dry us off.
