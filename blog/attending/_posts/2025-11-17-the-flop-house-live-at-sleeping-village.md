Marybeth and I got to see [The Flop House, A Podcast About Bad Movies](https://www.flophousepodcast.com/) discuss [Taking Care of Business](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/letterboxd-review-1074770403-taking-care-of-business) and it was thoroughly fun. There were no empty seats.

Elliott's presentation about DVDs was my favorite part.
