This weekend, our friend Maddie was in town and we got to introduce her to the sweaty fantastic energy that is [_Confidence Man_](https://www.confidenceman.com.au) - and in 90ÂºF heat at a crowded [Pride Fest](https://northalsted.com/main-events/chicago-pride-fest/), no less! She was grinning and dancing the whole time.

I will always jump at the chance to jump with the crowd at one of their confidently choreographed shows ([previously](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/blog/attending/confidence-man-at-subterranean), [previously](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/attending/confidence-man-at-lincoln-hall)) and they've never let me down.
