I've long been a fan of KAYTRANADA (see [his latest album](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/listening/aint-no-damn-way-by-kaytranada)) but have only ever been able to see him perform at outdoor venues (e.g. Lollapalooza), so I jumped at the chance to see him indoors at The United Center. And, damn, did he deliver.

He had center stage and it levitated above the crowd in a dense net of lasers while he danced and posed and generally got the crowd up and dancing along with him. He was having the best time performing, and the enthusiasm spread.

Then, one of my all-time favorite bands took the stage: Justice. They performed nearly the same show we had seen [one year ago at Radius](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/attending/justice-at-radius) but it's a helluva show and I'll happily see it a few more times. They played _Neverender_ as a beautiful refrain throughout the show, which was a welcome indulgence after Tame Impala skipped it entirely for [their show](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/attending/tame-impala-at-the-united-center).

It struck me what an odd pairing these two made in the same evening: KAYTRANADA's boisterous dancing vs. Justice's resolute bowing.
