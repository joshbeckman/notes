We got to see the last [Redacted at the Music Box Theatre](https://musicboxtheatre.com/films-and-events/redacted) tonight. Our good friend [Rob](https://www.instagram.com/robgrabo/) has been the organizer for years and our good friend Laura has directed many of them and starred in many as well. [Marybeth](https://marybethkram.com/) has also played a role in past shows.

The show's premise is that a writer that loves a [usually] famous/nostalgic movie and then stages a reading  of the script - with some acting and homemade props/costumes - with a _heavy_ dose of their commentary and editing. It would show in the cocktail lounge of the Music Box  and often would be standing-room-only. I always laughed incredibly hard.

This final show was a reading of _The Fifth Element_ and Laura was "Lilu" and a trained opera singer performed the full concert number and the seats were packed and it was fantastic.

But have hope! Redacted will move to a new theater! And we will follow them.
