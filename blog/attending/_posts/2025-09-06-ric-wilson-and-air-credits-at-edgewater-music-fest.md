Two Chicago bands playing in the street on a cool summer night got the crowd bouncing.

I had gone to see [Air Credits](http://www.aircredits.org/) at [Empty Bottle](https://www.joshbeckman.org/search/?q=%27empty-bottle-venue&keys=tags) years ago and it was so much fun. It's a duo (_Show You Suck_ and _The Hood Internet_) that is devoted to their aesthetic of "band from a future where the environment is ruined" and they have some fantastic bops. When I saw them previously, _Show You Suck_ wore the same cutoff jeans and spent half the concert down on the floor in the crowd. Their _BROADCASTED_ album is absolutely the best and you can only get it [on Bandcamp](https://aircredits.bandcamp.com/album/broadcasted) - go get it and you won't be disappointed.

The headliner was [Ric Wilson](https://ricwilsonmusic.com/), though, and he definitely won the crowd. He had a live jazz band and got everyone into Soul Train aisle dancing halfway through. The moon and the mood was high.
