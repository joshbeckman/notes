We braved the storms last night to watch Kandy Muse and Jimbo perform at Roscoeâ€™s, and it was a fantastic decision.

Watching Kandy command the crowd with sultry stares and seeing Jimbo rip the head off a doll to drink out of it like a water bottle (on the same stage) is a singular experience.

Riding bikes all the way home through the north side of the city was a perfect ending.
