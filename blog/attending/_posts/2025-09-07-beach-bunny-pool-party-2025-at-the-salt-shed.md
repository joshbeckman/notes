This second time seeing Chicago-native [Beach Bunny](https://www.beachbunnymusic.com/) ([previously](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/attending/riot-fest-2024-saturday#beach-bunny)) was in much colder weather but the stage still exudes warm spirits.

They have held this Pool Party for the last three years where they have a bunch of other bands perform with them for a whole afternoon and holding this kinda party-show at Salt Shed is the best: lots of food vendors, shops, space, and a skyline sunset make it especially lovely to listen to five sets.

Ned and I got there in time to hear [Sidney Gish](http://sidneygish.com/) ([previously](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/attending/jeff-rosenstock-at-the-salt-shed)) chatter and loop for the crowd. Then we heard [Annie DiRusso](https://www.anniedirusso.com/) joke and jam and [Soccer Mommy](https://soccermommyband.com/) calmly clang out their albums before Beach Bunny took the stage and the crowd really got going. All of their songs are short but they still rock.

It was nice to see the moon full and bright again.
