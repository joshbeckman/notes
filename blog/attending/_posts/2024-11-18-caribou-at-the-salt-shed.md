The [last time we saw Caribou play](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/attending/caribou-and-jessy-lanza), I had the time of my life\. This show did not disappoint, even with high expectations\.

Caribou doesn’t play for very long \- the set was only an 90 minutes or so \- but it’s a continuous play and the crowd dances throughout\. They mostly played the new album and we all loved it\.

Yuné Pinku was the opener and her music was pretty good but there was a giant music video on repeat behind her and it repeated continuously and for some reason it really distracted me\.
