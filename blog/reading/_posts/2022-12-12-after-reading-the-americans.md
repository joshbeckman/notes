Though I photographed professionally for years, and though I spent a great deal of that time photographing in the street, emulating the great street photographers, I had not read Robert Frank's _The Americans_ in person before this week. It's the most iconic street photography book - shot 1955-56.

I picked it up on my last walk through the bookstore - found it nestled between the bindings of the much larger format contemporary photography books.

I don't like writing in the margins of my photography books, so I took notes as I leafed through the pages over coffee this morning:

> It's so quiet - every photo has the people still, and hardly any are interacting with each other or much else in the frame.

> An intense focus on where people's eyelines are condensing, while (in other frames) obscuring faces to isolate a lone person in a group or remove a person from the scene while leaving their body as a form in the scene.

> He loves assembling lines of people and objects within the frame. Crescendos and diminuendos.

> The ordering of the photos doesn't tell a narrative of any individual place or people, but juxtaposes the lives of the wealthy with others struggling, the lives in a city with those on open farms, the environment of work with places of relaxation.

Separately, coincidentally, I watched all of _[Orson Welles' Sketch Book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEbZ_0XC-zY&list=PLxEfOhTrjfv3_-imU-gapxapDRibaZTD4)_ this afternoon as well - filmed in the same year. It was nice to have an audio representation of the same time to pair with the images.
