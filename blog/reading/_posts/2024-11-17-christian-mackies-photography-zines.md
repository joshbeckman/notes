[Christian Mackie](https://www.mackiec.xyz) is my coworker at [Shopify](http://shopify.com)\. He’s also a prolific photographer, and one I admire because of how he is able to package his work\.

I first encountered his work when he shared his [Japan 4x6](https://www.mackiec.xyz/japan-4x6-project) project, “An experimental online gallery that mimics the experience of sequencing physical 4x6 prints on a tabletop\.” It reminded me of [Daniel Arnold](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/797756758)’s fun [Image Database](https://imagedatabase.nyc) project/site/thing and was equally a joy to explore and play with\.

So when I discovered that Christian had printed a couple zines of his photos, I immediately ordered both\.

[*Where Are We Going*](https://www.mackiec.xyz/where-are-we-going-2023) is a clean and simple assembly of people using printed maps\. It’s a good execution of a pattern\. I love the blank page for “Notes” in the back\. I wish the big dot on the cover was red \- to mimic the “You are Here” dot on maps\. One of my favorite bits as I flipped through a second time was finding the images where people had powerful technology in hand \(smartphones, etc\.\) and yet they were navigating with the paper map instead\. Love to see it\.

[*We Find What We Like*](https://www.mackiec.xyz/we-find-what-we-like-2023) is a more personal collection \- juxtapositions of Christian’s first years in the UK\. I love the juxtaposition trope in photo edits\. I actually enjoyed this assembly quite a bit because I *didn’t* immediately understand why a few of the pairings were made\. So I lingered for a bit longer on them and ended up attributing them to Christian’s own memories \- something just before the shutter fire or just out of frame \- that married them in his mind\.

I’m collecting quite a few zines lately\. Personal ones like these are the best\.
