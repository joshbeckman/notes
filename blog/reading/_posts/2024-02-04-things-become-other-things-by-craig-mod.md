I finished reading [Things Become Other Things](https://shop.specialprojects.jp/products/things-become-other-things-1st-ed/) this morning\. I started it earlier in the week and devoured it quickly; I’ve long been a fan and [supporter of Craig Mod](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/who-and-why-and-how-im-funding#membership)\. This is the second ~book~ piece of art I’ve bought from Craig Mod \- I recommend [Kissa By Kissa](https://www.joshbeckman.org/books/after-reading-kissa-by-kissa) to everyone\.

This one is a love letter to a past friendship\. He walks through forests and towns and as he walks he travels his memories of a friendship lost long ago to childhood\. It’s beautiful and vulnerable and continues to reveal itself as you turn the pages of the beautifully bound book\. The tactile feel of this book\! It’s therapeutic to hold and encourages you to linger on each photograph\. Craig’s stories are rife with people, from his memory and from the road, but no person in any of the photographs\. It’s an uncanny juxtaposition, but it lets the photography take on the quality of a memory \- textural but echoing\.

[A highlight](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/671982380):
> The shop was supposed to close at five and I noticed it was five fifteen, so I shut my mouth and paid and thanked her\. I walked back to my inn along the shore under the last of the day’s light\. The waves broke and broke some more, like how a disease overtakes the body, or how a peninsula consumes itself, collapses, starts again\. Given enough time, a ceaselessly bashed seaside mountain briefly becomes a lion\.
