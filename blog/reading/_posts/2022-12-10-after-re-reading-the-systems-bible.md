I first read this book under a different name - _Systemantics_ - as a photocopier-scanned PDF found online who-knows-where over ten years ago.

It made a significant impact on me, a budding software developer being entrusted to build decently sized software systems with little oversight. It instilled in me a very healthy skepticism of my own (and anyone else's) ability to design the perfect system, the perfect software architecture, even the ability to diagnose a system's flaws. It trained me to distrust anything I built until proven otherwise, to assume some amount of failure in the operation of everything built around me.

And the book - the reason I love it so much - is that it trains you to _accept_ and _cherish_ these aspects of the systems you build and to which you trust your life.

This second reading I wanted to do in physical form, so I bought the book [from the author's widow](https://generalsystemantics.com/product/the-systems-bible/). Recommended - she's lovely and sent me personal emails when fulfilling the order.

Because I had somet time on my hands and because I find the tone of writing entertaining, I finished this book in only six days this time around. And the structure is such that I could have highlighted something on most pages, so I won't copy excerpts here.

I kind of think that if you buy this book, it should come with a copy of _[Thinking in &nbsp;Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_In_Systems:_A_Primer)_ - and vice versa. One will incinerate your confidence in system design and the other will rekindle your hope.
