I finished reading _[Braiding Sweetgrass](https://milkweed.org/book/braiding-sweetgrass)_ by Robin Wall Kimmerer tonight and I am filled with gratitude\.

It took me a long time to finish this book, because I was overcome with emotion after several of the chapters\. It conveyed so well the idea of a gratitude culture of a society where abundance is encouraged and reciprocity interactions and drives at abundance\.

It was interesting to read the book by Deb Chachra about infrastructure while waiting to finish this Braiding Sweetgrass book\. Both touch on the climate crisis as a driving force for people to re\-orient themselves to a sustainable  \- what Robin Wall Kimmerer would a gratitude based \- culture\. Rob stories of her family and her children were incredibly moving and caused me to put the book down several times\. 

I want to find ways to remind myself of this book multiple times a year and especially when I’m outside in the world\.
