This book was recommended to me by [Mike Shaver](https://github.com/shaver) a couple years ago and I only just now got around to reading  it. Carlos has made it [freely available](https://carlos.bueno.org/optimization/), which is nice.

It's a fast read, and engaging because it blends detailed real-world stories with the usual "theory" about optimizations. I'd recommend it if you haven't recently dedicated some time to optimization thinking. [Here are my highlights](https://www.joshbeckman.org/sources/#47665610).
