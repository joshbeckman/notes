I pre-ordered *[Ensorcelled](https://eliotpeper.com/books/ensorcelled)* on a recommendation from Craig Mod and read it this morning over tea and cold sunshine and it had me brushing away tears by the end.

It reminded me of a miniature, outdoorsy *[Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/reading/tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow)* - another game story that had me choked up multiple times. Eliot is a bit more flowery with language, but I appreciated the emotion he was able to pack into only a few pages.

I haven't been camping or hiking in a few months, and this *really* made me want to scramble outside.

Some highlights:

> Behind, the city receded, a glass and steel jewel bathed in dawn's red-gold, flaws rectified by distance.

> But we hiked up and in, up and in, up and in, the landscape revealing itself in complex folds that were invisible to a distant observer.
