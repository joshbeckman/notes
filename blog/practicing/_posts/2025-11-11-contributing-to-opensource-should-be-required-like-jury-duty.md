A note I found in my journal, from seven years ago, on the day I was summoned to participate in a jury of my peers:

> I have to go to jury duty as a member of this democracy. what if I had a summons to contribute to open source software because I use FOOS?

I was _so_ happy to go spend a day exercising my membership in this hallmark of democracy: a participation requirement in return for the benefits I enjoy under due process of the law. Ultimately, I was dismissed because of my connection with the law (several friends and family members practice law).

But it got me dreaming of a world where software developers, having enjoyed the benefits of open-source software and libraries and tools, having built their fortunes on the shared work of the community, were then summoned regularly to use their knowledge and talents to maintain and improve that shared resource.
