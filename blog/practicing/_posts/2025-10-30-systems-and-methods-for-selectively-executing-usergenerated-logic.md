Our (me and some of my team members at Shopify) U.S. patent application (number 10677, with the menacing all-caps title "SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR SELECTIVELY EXECUTING USER-GENERATED LOGIC") was published today. It may be several years before the application grants. This has taken a _long_ time but it's been interesting to see the machinery of patents at work in a large company.

Shopify's (rough (this isn't speaking for my employer)) stance on patents is that they are net-negative but it's best to file patents for things that are valuable, while patent law is still enforced. This protects you from being sued by patent tolls; you don't have to use them as weapons against others. I like that stance, for a big company like Shopify.

The patent application is available on [the UPSTO public search](https://ppubs.uspto.gov/pubwebapp/static/pages/ppubsbasic.html) if you search for `20250335250`.
