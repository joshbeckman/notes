2025 was the first full year I had basic analytics on this site ([via Goatcounter](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/analytics-experiment-switching-from-tinylitics-to-goatcounter)), so I figured I would review the most popular posts/pages. I also wrote more in 2025 than in (any?) prior years.

This data is [publicly available here](https://joshbeckman.goatcounter.com/?hl-period=&period-start=2025-01-01&period-end=2026-01-01&filter=&group=day).

## Totals

~30,140 visits in the year, with a peak of 7,613 on 2025-08-11.

I published [215 blog posts](https://www.joshbeckman.org/search/?q=*&keys=&type=post&category=blog&after=2024-12-31&before=2026-01-01), [23 replies](https://www.joshbeckman.org/search/?q=*&keys=&type=post&category=replies&after=2024-12-31&before=2026-01-01), [192 notes](https://www.joshbeckman.org/search/?q=*&keys=&type=post&category=notes&after=2024-12-31&before=2026-01-01), [343 exercises](https://www.joshbeckman.org/search/?q=*&keys=&type=post&category=exercise&after=2024-12-31&before=2026-01-01), and [7 proverbs](https://www.joshbeckman.org/search/?q=*&keys=&type=post&category=proverbs&after=2024-12-31&before=2026-01-01). I hope to publish more than that in 2026.

I'm actually kind of embarrassed that the Jury Duty post is so popular. In retrospect, I only half stand behind it; I think it's too flippant.

I'm happy the UAI post did so well - it was a concept I developed and anchored on at work all year and I think it has been immensely useful for aiming my teams.

## Top Referrers

| Referrer | Visits |

| (unknown) | 31% |

| tldrwebdev | 2% |
| andjosh ([my newsletter](https://www.joshbeckman.org/subscribe/#email-newsletter)) | 1% |

I *think* the high proportion of `(unknown)` referrals is coming from internally-shared links to my site. I love that! It tells me that people find my writing useful enough to share *themselves* rather than just consuming it from a feed or something. I want my work to be a helpful reference.
