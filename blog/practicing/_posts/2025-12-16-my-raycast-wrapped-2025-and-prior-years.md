I've been using [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) on my work and personal computers for over 3 years now and heavily use it ([example](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/raycast-snippets-for-conventional-comments-commits)) for text snippets and app/site navigation. It's so much more than an app launcher and still way better than MacOS defaults and the other competition. I heartily recommend it if you're using a Mac.

They've been providing their own version of "Raycast Wrapped" for years and I just got mine for 2025:

I think a change for 2025 was that I leaned further into quicklinks. I still need to remember to use my bookmarks and history extension/integration for faster recall of pages (so I can close tabs more aggressively).
