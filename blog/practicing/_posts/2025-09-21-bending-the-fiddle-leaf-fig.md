This fiddle leaf fig has been in two homes with us now for about 7 years, maybe 8. It first grew from about  a foot tall to our 8' ceilings at our old home. Once we moved here, to the capacious 25' main room, it struggled to find the light for a bit. 

Soon it discovered the upper window and has been drunk on that unfiltered sunlight for so long that it had plastered itself all over the glass. Its leaves were burnt from the heat and it was stifling its own growth.

So I took some time over the weekend to bend it away from the light, back into our lives. I hope it respects my help and lives with us for many more years.
