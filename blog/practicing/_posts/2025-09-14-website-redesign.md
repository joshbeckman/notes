I've spent the last week or so redesigning my personal blog/site to make images/video/code/tables stand out more while remaining readably inline. I recoded a video walkthrough:

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ssEja-yAUqI?si=hV7BAmRmUpcMl_Na" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<img width="1617" height="1168" alt="Example of the new design with high contrast" src="/assets/images/03127241-d3f8-482d-9d88-79a64c3495cf.png" />

I got inspired by [Carl Barenbrug](https://carlbarenbrug.com/)'s site layout that features an off-center, 3-column grid that balances text readability with large inline images. I've seen other sites that rely on centered text and centered images for this kind of thing, but this ratio feels much more elegant to me; it evokes [the golden ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio).

Carl's site is _very_ minimalist with low contrast elements. I retained my high-contrast, high-legibility aspects and mostly took layout styles.

The [test page](/blog/test) has a full list of example elements/rendering, but here are some before+after examples:
