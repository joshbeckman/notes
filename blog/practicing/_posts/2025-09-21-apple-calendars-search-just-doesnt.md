I cannot, for the life of me, figure out what Apple Calendar's search feature doesn't return events/results with titles that exactly match my query.

I'm on a recent version of the operating system. The calendar is the most basic version Apple Calendar provides me. I am typing the words exactly. Other calendar apps return results based on the same query. I made the event weeks ago. Other search terms return results. 

Why do I have to rely on my own memory instead of Apple's software? Now I question every use of this app, if this most basic functionality does not work.
