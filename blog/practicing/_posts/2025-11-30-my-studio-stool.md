I bought the instruction zine for [The Studio Stool from Manual](https://www.manual.is/the-studio-stool) months ago and then cut up some 3/4" plywood sometime this summer and finally reorganized enough to finish it yesterday.

But I didn't make mine exactly to pattern. I wanted to make mind a bit "my own" and so I simplified the dimensions and complicated the fastening to eliminate the offset.[^1] To fasten without an offset, I found some 1/4" bamboo garden stakes and cut them into 2" dowel rods. I drilled holes and then glued the dowels in place to hold the whole assembly through and through.

I used [3/4" A/C birch plywood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVxldyIa0Bg) for mine because I love the endgrain it brings to a sandwich alignment like this. I finished mine with boiled linseed oil (as I do with most wood these days) to really bring out the whorls and grain.

I don't have a table saw - only my jigsaw - so the cuts aren't straight on this, but the seat feels perfectly firm and stable.

## Future

I've long wanted to build my own [Rietveld-esque crate stool / table (written up by Piper Haywood)](https://piperhaywood.com/rietveld-stool/), so maybe that will be my next build. The whole idea of [crate furniture](https://piperhaywood.com/rietveld-brigham-didion/?__readwiseLocation=) obviously appeals to me: so functional and efficient and customizable to your own comfort.

More crate furniture (or "box furniture") reading/watching:

- Another I want to make: [Steltman chair](https://rietveldoriginals.com/en/products/steltman-chair#product-details)

[^1]: I forgot to accommodate the extra 3/4" on the two cross beams, so I found a way to gracefully improvise.
