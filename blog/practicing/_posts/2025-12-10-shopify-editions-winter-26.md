Jump to [15:10 of the X spaces livestream](https://x.com/Shopify/status/1998754028314882421?s=20) to get a brief overview of a big project I championed for a bit this fall: **AI-generated workflows**. ([view in Editions](https://www.shopify.com/ca/editions/winter2026#sidekick))

<img width="1294" height="712" alt="Editions feature page of Sidekick + Flow" src="/assets/images/71f8da65-6b8b-413d-a8fa-384983c1522d.png" />

Elsewhere, Flow had several other big projects launch, like a whole "test your workflows before you activate them" system and a complete editor redesign: [Shopify Editions Winter '26: The Renaissance Edition](https://www.shopify.com/ca/editions/winter2026#operations).

It was difficult to get here, and I'm so proud of my team.
