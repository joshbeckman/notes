I've been reading [The Power Broker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_Broker) with [this podcast/book\-club](https://99percentinvisible.org/club/) and it's really good\!

I’m not usually one for book clubs, but I thought I’d give another try\. This is a book I’ve been meaning to read for a year, but I’ve been intimidated by its size and presence\. One of the hosts of this club is on another favorite podcast of mine and I admire him, so I figured this was a golden opportunity to jump on board\.

I’m in the third section of the book, and *yes* it’s as good as everyone says it is\. It’s written like a legal thriller movie and I’m taking notes\.
