I had the day off from work today in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. and the work of others like him to improve us.

Building off [the import script I wrote yesterday]( /importing-readwise-into-day-one/), I sat down this morning to more accurately pull [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) highlights into my [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) [media log]( /tag/media-log/) journal. &nbsp;I wanted to have actual importing of images and timestamps associated to _when_ I was reading things (rather than when I imported them).

So, I wrote a Ruby script to interact with [the Readwise API](https://readwise.io/api_deets). The script grew in complexity, but it delivered nicely after a couple hours. It pulled recent highlights, organized by book, downloaded cover images for each, and imported each as a correctly timestamped entry, with formatting I liked a bit better than before.

Then, I thought about the holiday and the communities I should support and foster. There happened to be no Readwise Ruby gem for interacting with their API.

I havenâ€™t published a gem in a while, so I set about extracting my scripted logic into actual classes and something that would be generally useful to the public.

All that is now available as the [v0.1.0 release of the Readwise Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/readwise) as of this afternoon. It's not much, but it will pull down your highlights and books, nicely accessible as manipulatable data. And it's [open for contributions on GitHub](https://github.com/andjosh/readwise-ruby/tree/bab73880419d526691e701adfccf4b685ab793be).

## My Import Script

With the gem published, here is the actual import script I'm running now. Notably, it now:

- Reads and writes a last-import-date value to prevent accidentally importing old content.
- Downloads cover art and embeds it
- Builds on the `readwise` gem with custom formattig for books and highlights that I didn't want to include in the public gem.
