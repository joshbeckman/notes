I've been using [Fitbod](https://fitbod.me/) for strength workout planning for I think 3 years now. I like it because it tracks which lifts I do and aims to suggest workouts that stress new muscles in new ways throughout my training cycles.

This year (I don't _think_ they offered this last year?) they built their own "2024 wrapped" style report (like [My GitHub Wrapped 2024](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/github-wrapped-2024) and [Apple Music Replay 2024](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/listening/apple-music-replay-2024) and [Strava Year in Sport 2024](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/strava-year-in-sport-2024)): [Fitbod Flex](https://app.fitbod.me/year/2024/9bc865e2-3125-491c-8c30-3c59e0442cf1).

Kind of like the Strava report, this is mostly just fun to look at. I do applaud this trend of annual reviews from the apps I use, though. And I appreciate that _this_ one is actually generated after the full year has finished.
