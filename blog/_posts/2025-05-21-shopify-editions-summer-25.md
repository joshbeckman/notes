![Flow in Editions](/assets/images/0c8d98d0-3d14-44fa-a205-059aedab9b9d.png)

I'm so proud to see my teams' work featured in today's [Summer â€™25 Shopify Editions](https://www.shopify.com/editions/summer2025#operations). Shopify Flow has callouts in both the Operations and Developer sections with great new capabilities that expand what merchants and developers can build on Shopify.

Personally, I'm so happy to see one of my own prototypes come to fruition: [full support for HTTP request/response data](https://changelog.shopify.com/posts/flow-improved-send-http-request-action-enables-secure-connections-to-external-systems-and-returns-data-to-the-workflow) and [safe secret storage](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shopify-flow/reference/actions/send-http-request#secrets)! Now, everything is possible.
