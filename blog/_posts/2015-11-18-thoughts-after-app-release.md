In the first week of the available iOS app, the [Narro](//narro.co) community nearly doubled in size.

I was happily surprised! So far, every feature I have built for Narro has been a direct result of a) some idea I had for myself, or b) some request made by an existing user. The iOS app was no exception. As such, I was expecting mostly extant users to download Narro on iOS.

I have thought before about building things for potential Narro users. I think this proves that a feature can both satisfy current customers and attract new, unknown, markets. Hereâ€™s to happy discoveries.
