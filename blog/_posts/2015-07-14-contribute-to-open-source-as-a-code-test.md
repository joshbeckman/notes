I counted up the number of open source code projects I actively used or extended today. Just in the last twenty hours, I tallied over 50 libraries and applications and resources.

When I’m evaluating potential hires onto [our team](http://tech.threadmeup.com), I’m looking at things like previous work experience. I’m also actively looking for proof of someone giving back to the development community.

I usually ask candidates to try their hand at a coding project - their choice from a couple cases. One involves a node middleware library, the other involves data visualization of [drone strikes](http://dronestre.am). After long thought, I’m adding to that list of choices.

When evaluating potential team members, I’ll also accept someone identifying and fixing a bug or adding a feature in an open source project. I think more companies should do this as well.

I’ve seen many sites dedicated to laying out test questions and fizz-buzz problems for hiring managers. Imagine how much would be fixed if, for just _half_ of candidates, we instead asked them to tackle open issues on public, popular repositories.
