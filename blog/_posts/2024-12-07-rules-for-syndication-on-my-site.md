With all my recent [outward](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/how-to-crosspost-to-mastodon-with-jekyll) [posting](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/crossposting-to-bluesky-from-jekyll) and [inward](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/pesos-mastodon-to-jekyll) importing of my writing on various platforms, I should write down how I’m planning all of this\. Otherwise, it could get messy: POSSE and PESOS jangling noisily\.

The rules for all this cross\-posting and syndication are:
- I write posts mainly here
- Replies I make on other platforms get imported as replies here
- New posts I make on other platforms get imported as blog posts here
- All get syndicated out to other platforms *IFF* they do not *rely* on the context of a single platform

Examples of how a post can “rely” on a platform’s context:
- It’s a reply to a post local to that platform
- It targets or mentions a user of that platform \(e\.g\. with an embedded mention link\)

This way, if someone sees a post from me natively on one platform or another they can interact with it fully and with the least surprise \(e\.g\. they won’t click a username and be directed to another platform\)\. And anyone can always view my stuff on my site and see everything\.
