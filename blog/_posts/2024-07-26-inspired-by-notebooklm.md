I watched [this interview with Steven Johnson about Google's NotebookLM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fiiWhma-iA) tonight and got inspired. 

This is something that I could build on top of my own website. Something where you could - in a browsing session - collect notes to build up context and then interrogate an LLM based on that context, you could save responses or really just add your own ad hoc notes to that context and continue asking questions. This is something like a directed version of the [Insight page](/insight) - where you can provide a sequenced list of posts and ad-hoc notes as context and ask a question.

If I build this on my personal site that anyone else can use it as well rather than being locked away in my local machine.

I'm already building something like this at work, in the context of my daily lab notebook that I keep in GitHub issues...
