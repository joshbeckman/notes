I've been reading this blog https://rachelbythebay\.com for so many years
now that it's become one of my canonical ideas of what valuable writing
online should be\.

I don't know why but I read [this post](https://rachelbythebay\.com/w/2023/05/30/eng/) today and it struck me as a
great example of why I think it's valuable: human, down\-to\-earth,
practical, pedantic, short\.

If you're building software, you should be reading this blog\.
