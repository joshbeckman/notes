I make reading time for myself every day\. \(I am really enjoying the Reader app for consuming everything, encouraging ‘discarding’ of updates, and encouragement to note/notate what I read\.\)
I need to writing time for myself every day as well\. I have been pretty good at making a journal ‘entry’ every day now for a while, but I don’t think they’re all beneficial as sources of reflection or inspiration \(what I want out of my journaling practice and content\)\.
This \- right here \- *this* is what I need to be spending more time doing\. I’ve gotten better at making this time and filling it with writing practice ​*at work*​, but I need to make the same space and change in my personal time\.

How/where can I fit it in?

How about after work hours? I can spend just a couple minutes winding my mind down with a journaling session\. I have recently been doing this in my work notes, but I often find my mind straying out into personal things that I keep out of my work log, so it would be useful to write out a personal log at that time as well\. Usually, at that time of day, I want to be done working but haven’t yet revitalized myself enough to go exercise or go out\.

And then, of course, I should easily spend more time writing \(instead of just consuming/reading\) on Saturday and Sunday mornings \(just like this\)\. It’s perfect \- I feel calm and reflective, Marybeth is asleep, the sun is up, etc\. These are all aspects that make me want to create something and experiment\.
