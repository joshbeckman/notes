One of the things I want to do as I continue to embed myself in my personal site is use it to \- in whatever small way \- help others\.

One way I can do that, following the recent US election, is to resist fascism and political movements I know are harmful to people\. I need to commit to publishing my thoughts about how we should be governing ourselves and what I want government to do\.

Things don't change unless we force them to, and other people don't know they should change unless we communicate\. And my website is a big way of communicating with people I don't see every day\. And, in this new world of large language models, the publicly published internet is becoming even more important, as machine learning data sets are trained on what we publish online\. If my writing is digested into an LLM and then transformed into "AI" output for non\-technical people elsewhere, that's another [pathway for me to have an impact](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/820169968)\. 

We have to [leave breadcrumbs](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/801368263) for others to find, to lead us all toward a better world\.
