The U.S. legislative body is in a tough spot these days. In light of an executive branch that I didn't vote for and that I see actively harming those around me, as well as a judicial branch that I see acting against my wishes, I am trying to turn more to my legislators (U.S. Representatives and Senators) as my conduits for making things better.

I want more of my neighbors to do the same, so here are the steps I'm taking that I think you can follow.

## Tracking

To get informed as to what is going on, you need to confirm who is representing you: use [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/members?q=%7B%22congress%22%3A119%7D).

I don't want to have to manually check on their actions, so I subscribe to their activity (votes, sponsorships, etc.) using [GovTrack.us](https://www.govtrack.us/list/sIqsJjPNxVLxfkEY). It basically compiles the voting data from [Roll Call Votes by the U.S. Congress at Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/roll-call-votes) but lets you subscribe over email or RSS. I'm using RSS for their actual votes (high frequency - you could instead do a weekly summary) and I'm subscribed to GovTrack's weekly email about upcoming legislation that they _will_ be voting on. I recommend you make your own account and set your own subscription preferences.

Then I also subscribe to the promotional communications from each of the legislators. Each one has a YouTube channel or newsletter or something (linked from their profile on congress.gov or govtrack.us) where they promote their own view of their activities. I subscribe to those, too; it lets me know what they think is important to communicate. 

## Influencing

I'm pretty lucky in that my current reps _mostly_ act in ways that are aligned with my thinking. Duckworth is better than Durbin is better than Quigley, but they're all mostly voting how I would ask them to.

I go to protests and demonstrations when I can ([previously](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/rallying-duckworth-and-durbin)) to bring a physical presence and to bear witness to my representatives, but often I question how effective that can be. It's obviously not enough. I think it mostly helps influence those around me.

When my reps send out surveys or newsletter updates, I respond when I have an opinion. If they're asking for input, I want to give it. I sign up for their virtual town halls if they have them.

Everyone (my politically involved friends) says calling actually works, so I've recently begun using [5 Calls](https://5calls.org/) to quickly call and track calling these U.S. representatives. My plan is to track bills and votes and call about something at least once a month. There is enough controversy about bills already proposed that I think I'll at least one reason to call every month.
