I don't quite know why, but this latest move by President Trump and Elon Musk and their idiotic [Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Government_Efficiency) extra-governmental team is putting me in a mood to write something. I've already been [physically protesting against this group](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/rallying-duckworth-and-durbin) - to my elected representatives - to little effect.

At the end of last week, Musk laid off the entire [18F](https://18f.org/) team. I have a long-time friend who had worked in that group for years; luckily they're still at work within the government, having moved recently to an adjacent team in the [USDS](https://www.usds.gov/). Additionally, I have [parasocial friends](https://eli.li/93401-2025-03-01-14-40-24) who also worked directly to improve the United States' digital technology in 18F who are now gone from that service. I *know* how essential these software engineers and designers were to the functioning of our government's software and infrastructure.

The reason for their elimination - as stated by Musk - is that they were "a far-left group" within the government because of their work on creating the Internal Revenue Serviceâ€™s free tax-filing service. A program that literally had the _only_ aim of reducing waste and saving taxpayers money was deemed _far-left_ and then was eliminated _for that reason_. It's shameful - to me, as a citizen - alongside the shame I felt last week as I watched [the video](https://www.c-span.org/program/white-house-event/president-trump-meets-with-ukrainian-president-zelensky/656418) of Trump and Vance petulantly insult President Zelensky as he begged for the lives of his own citizens.

I think one reason I am anchoring on this 18F removal is that they give me some hope. Here's their parting message:

> We are dedicated to the American public and we're not done yet.

So may we all remain dedicated and effective.
