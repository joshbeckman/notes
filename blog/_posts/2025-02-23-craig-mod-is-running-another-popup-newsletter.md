I _love_ the pop-up, only-available-in-your-inbox, newsletters from [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com/). He's running another this week, and today's first issue invigorated me. I heavily encourage you to subscribe if you like travel, personal stories, or photography: [About a Nightingale](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/202/)
