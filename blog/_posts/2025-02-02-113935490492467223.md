<p>I&#39;ve been wanting to review/think about music and albums recently. I want something like letterboxd but for music. So far, the closest thing I&#39;ve found is <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="">rateyourmusic.com</span><span class="invisible"></span></a></p><p>I just don&#39;t like that it doesnâ€™t have an API or any way to get whatever I write there into my own site (without copying and pasting things each time).</p>
