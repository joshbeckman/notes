On repeat: [youtube.com/watch?v=cgULtrAfISw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgULtrAfISw)

I have been in the practice of writing down my daily tasks, ideas, steps of building, conversation points, random links, handy tidbits, etc for a few years now. These daily notes have been invaluable in reconciling long weekend with the tasks of a Monday’s morning. While working at startups, they have also been the only source of long-forgotten, one-off, code snippets/fixes and sources of pattern recognition in customer feedback. Yesterday, I was reading the lovely [_Lab Girl_](https://www.amazon.com/Lab-Girl-Hope-Jahren/dp/1101873728) (through the generosity of [Jane Kim](https://twitter.com/happygeometry)) and was reminded of these notes’ similarity to the lab notes that we were forced to commit in every science course. Reading more into that led me to the [BERG concept of weeknotes](https://medium.com/job-garden/a-pre-history-of-weeknotes-plus-why-i-write-them-and-perhaps-why-you-should-too-week-16-31a4a5cbf7b0). I like it.

I have loved the podcast [Reply All](https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all/all) for a few years now and so jumped at [a recent episode](https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all/124#episode-player) that intersected with our startup’s operations. I led a discussion with the company about Amazon’s fake review problem and extrapolated some of the history not covered in the episode. I tried to paint a picture of the history of online marketplaces.

- We purchased things from each other on the first forums (heavily based on reputation).
- We moved to posting our goods on Craigslist, where you could reach a broader audience, but reputation was non-existent.
- We moved to buying on Ebay, where seller reputation was prominent, buyers competed for items, and payment was easy.
- We moved to buying on Amazon, where _product_ reputation is prominent and multiple sellers compete for _you_.
- What’s next? This is a conversation point I tried to push, but people replied that Amazon is probably the peak of this mountain. I hardly agree.

Marybeth had been part of the [48 Hour Film Project](http://www.48hourfilm.com/chicago-il/films) a couple weeks ago, and the premiere night was Sunday. We watched something like ten 6-7 minute films all of different genre and created within 2 days time. The variety was wonderful. One film stood out a bit. It was created by and starred the oldest entrants, was shot on a cell-phone camera, had slipped-up lines and audio, and had no digital post-production. It was obvious that the creators also had _way_ more fun than any other group. I’m going to remember that part.

Here’s a photo from the Sylvan Esso concert we just barely attended last week. They were much better live than in their albums, and I loved their albums.

I had a serendipitous lunch with my old friend [Josh Martin](http://jawsmartin.com). Honestly, whenever I spend time with him, I feel ten times as excited to work on new ideas. As always, he encouraged me to share more of my ideas with other people. So here I am, [writing a newsletter]( /newsletter), again).
