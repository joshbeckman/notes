Highscalability\.com posted today that he’s shutting down \(selling\) the site.
And I commented on there about how much it meant to me to read his posts a while back\. 

It was the first time in a while that I’ve commented on a site or posted online\. And it felt good\. I need to do that more\. Find a way to comment back and forth with people online\. In a more meaningful way than fast social media\.
