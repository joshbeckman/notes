We had simply the best of times at Bill and Emily's wedding a few weeks ago. Marybeth officiated the ceremony (she worked very hard and it all paid off - heartfelt and entertaining). The reception at Salvage One out in Chicago's West Loop nieghborhood was eclectic and filled with non-stop dancing.

Lukcily, we had friends staying with us for the wedding, and so invited a group over to our home after the reception to continue the fun.

We also got to spend a Saturday with Emily and Bill a few weeks later and I'm happy to report that they're still married!
