Just like [my Apple Music year\-in\-review](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/listening/apple-music-replay-2024), [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/beckman_josh) wants to give me an annual aggregation before the year is done\. But here are their highlights \(which I feel must be incorrect, because I *know* I hiked more than 25 miles \- double that in [the Cirque trip](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/traveling/cirque-of-the-towers-2024) alone\!\):

Active hours:
- 171 hours total (top 11% on Strava)
- November was most active with 21hr

After reading through this exercise data, I think I should be pulling this stuff into my site\. So I’ll probably be building a system to pull exercise activities into this blog in the new year\. That way I can aggregate this stuff myself like I do [for my music listening](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/listening/)\. Then I can be more sure of its accuracy and I can archive it under my own control
