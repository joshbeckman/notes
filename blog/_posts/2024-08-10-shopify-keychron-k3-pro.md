This spring I replaced my [Customized Keychron K1](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/keyboard-update-customized-keychron-k1) with a customized [Shopify Keychron K3 Pro](https://shopify.supply/products/shopify-keyboard). Mine won't look like the one you can order from the public Shopify store because I got an early employees-only version.

I like this keyboard _so_ much more than the K1. It's got a smaller footprint and it sits lower to the table, making it that much easier for me to type for long sessions. Of course I have it wired because I have zero tolerance for latency from my computer peripherals (any lag makes me question my sanity).

## Customization

Of course I had to customize my tool. I swapped in a keycap from the K1, to remember what came before. I've taped up a few of the keys I want to feel for rather than search for.

I've also remapped the screenshot and lighting-effects keys to be `F16` and `F17` which I then have mapped to various macros for different programs/websites (using [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/)). [Keychron's new Launcher key-remapping tool](https://www.keychron.com/blogs/news/how-to-use-launcher-to-program-your-keyboard) is much easier than the old VIA site.
