Code performance, reliability, security, cleanliness. These things are not achieved through big sweeps and special efforts. They are only really possible by baking the practices into every day and each decision. You can’t focus on fixing them for a week. You need to [invest in them slowly](https://www.joshbeckman.org/2020/05/18/slow-tech-investment/), constantly, over the life of the project. (Thoughts after reading about [why NetNewsWire is fast](https://inessential.com/2020/05/18/why_netnewswire_is_fast), listening to a [code audit webinar](https://info.thoughtbot.com/rails-application-code-audit-workshop), and thinking about how we’ve done so much with 2 engineers at OfficeLuv.)
