I've been [syndicating](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/rules-for-syndication-on-my-site) my posts [to Bluesky](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/crossposting-to-bluesky-from-jekyll) and [to Mastodon](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/how-to-crosspost-to-mastodon-with-jekyll) all of 2025. These are the two generalist "social media platforms" that I use [actively](https://www.joshbeckman.org/about/#active-accounts). And by "actively use" I mean:
- syndicate my blog posts there
- open the site's homepage and scan general topics a couple times a week
- reply to other people's posts there
  - see [my Mastodon replies in 2025](https://www.joshbeckman.org/search/?q=mastodon&keys=tags&type=post&category=replies&after=2024-12-31&before=2026-01-01)

- reply to other people's replies on my posts
- occasionally, I'll post directly to the platform, which is then ingested into my site

So, how is it going?

There are a ton of people on both platforms, but in my experience there's not much overlap of people or sentiment or engagement between them.

Blluesky is more like the journalist/artist/author/politician population, with a skew toward left/central politics. I see my actual political representatives posting there, so I message/reply to them on that platform. I still don't see any "normal" people on there, though. No one I know in real life has been posting to Bluesky regularly.

Mastodon seems to me to have become almost exclusively a niche platform for technically-minded people. I see my colleagues in software and "expert" communities (science, research, mathematics, design, etc.) posting on that platform, so I message/reply to them there. I still don't know any "normal" people in my life that even *have* a Mastodon account.

I used to have both apps installed on my phone but this Fall I uninstalled them. I was opening them just to see what was new and to see any notifications. (It's *very* frustrating to me that neither platform has the option to have my interactions/notifications emailed to me. I have to go to their site to check for them.) But inevitably I would scroll for a bit and just see a lot of people complaining about the world (I sympathize) and also complaining about each other in petty ways (I abhor). I always left that interaction in a worse mood than I began it, so I stopped doing it. Now, I just open the websites directly once a week or so, *maybe* I respond to someone, then leave.

I made this using [Olof's Bluesky Wrapped 2025](https://www.madebyolof.com/bluesky-wrapped/joshbeckman.org) site.

I'm getting more "engagement" on Bluesky, but it's mostly "hearts", so I don't feel particularly engaged. I'll keep syndicating there, as I think it's sometimes helpful to people.

## Mastodon

I used [Mastodon Wrapped: Your Year in Review](https://mastodon-wrapped.vercel.app/) to generate these stats. The [Wrapstodon 2025 provided on mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@joshbeckman/wrapstodon/2025/5a5b5aecc799995e) was pretty bare-bones.

I'm getting less "engagement" on Mastodon, but I feel like the replies are higher quality when they do happen. I'll keep syndicating there, as I think it's sometimes helpful to people.

## Syndication

I'm still only syndicating my Blog posts to these platforms. Maybe I should start posting my Notes? Other people post links with comments all the time, which is basically what my Notes are...
