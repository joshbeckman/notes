Hundreds of thousands of us flooded downtown Chicago today, shutting down the Loop to demonstrate our disapproval of the fascist Trump administration and their terrifying anti-immigrant, anti-citizen, inhuman actions. Disgustingly, instead of paying attention to the population, Trump spent exorbitant public funds on a military parade. We marched for hours and ran into friends and there were no conflicts and we were happy to be there together.
