I've been going back and forth in my head for the last couple years, bouncing between the dream of a bright coworking space and the lure of my perfected home studio.

Every time I go on a work trip for Shopify and share an office floor with a bunch of coworkers, I have serendipitous run-ins and catch glimpses of good ideas on whiteboards and enjoy the walk around the block and love the friends I make. And every time I get back home and go back to my bunker studio (e.g. [Desk, January 14, 2024](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/working/desk-january-14-2024)) I yearn to get those feelings back in my day-to-day work. 

So I'll spend a week or two researching shared office space within a couple miles of me: price, amenities, distance. I've even visited a couple. But they're never as collaborative as I dream. And it ends up feeling like a waste.

My home studio is so refined for my work: zero distractions, a great desk setup, tools to build whatever I want, anything I want to drink, a yard, cats. And you can't beat the price.

So now I'm committing to working hard in the studio and then _leaving_: going to meetups, walking around the block to greet neighbors, connecting meaningfully with friends online. I'm inspired by the home studios of [Van Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8bzWKBvZsE&t=30s) and [Noah Kahline](https://noahkalina.com/newsletter) and [Casey Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb60rrtTddQ) and my friend Sarah - make your own workspace at home and find connection out in the world, rather than forcing the two into the same space.
