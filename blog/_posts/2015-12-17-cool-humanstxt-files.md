I was making `robots.txt` and `humans.txt` files for Narro recently, and I wanted to find a few unique examples. I was looking for something that included more than the boilerplate code from [humanstxt.org](http://humanstxt.org). I think that the `humans.txt` file should be place for a bit of expression. I think rigid structure should be avoided. Please send me any others, but here are the interesting ones I found:

- [Tumblr](//tumblr.com/humans.txt)
- [TeeSpring](//teespring.com/humans.txt)
- [Medium](//medium.com/humans.txt)
- [Narro](//narro.co/humans.txt)
- [GitHub](//github.com/humans.txt) (simply because it is _massive_)
- [New York Times](//nytimes.com/humans.txt)
- [Mozilla](//mozilla.org/humans.txt)
