There’s this video game trailer for [Everything](https://cdn.jwplayer.com/previews/SrNsE3Jo-dYsrOfVj) that I’ve watched over a dozen times\. I ripped the audio and downloaded it to my phone years ago so I could listen to it on repeat\. I think it’s beautiful\. I think it has [some](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/678877056) [wisdom](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/678878436) within it\.

Recently the game has become [available on a platform that we have](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/everything-switch/) in the house, so I hope to finally play it this spring\.

As I was digging more into the game, I found [the website of its creator](https://www.davidoreilly.com/) and it’s beautiful in a different way\. I hope you explore\.
