My [2025 YouTube Recap](https://www.youtube.com/recap) was delivered today. It seems they calculate their "top" metrics based on minutes watched, not number of videos watched.

## Top Channels

My top channels from this year:
- RuPaul's Drag Race
  - For watching season/episode recaps
- [Noah Kalina](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/hotline-show-by-noah-kalina)
  - For photography talk and inspiration
- Boiler Room
  - For amazing DJ sets
- Herons Bonsai
  - For gardening and artistic inspiration
- Last Week Tonight
  - For political and cultural commentary

## Comparison

I definitely watched YouTube _more_ this year than in previous years (and [uploaded more videos myself](https://www.joshbeckman.org/search/?q=%27youtube&keys=tags)) and I only expect that to increase next year. Still, I wish there was another video streaming platform to compete with it. (I pay for YouTube premium because watching ads is horrendous.)
