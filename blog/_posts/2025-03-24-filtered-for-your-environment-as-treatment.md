First thing I did this morning after I got dressed was grab a screwdriver and tighten up the screws in the door handle to the common mail area of our building.

Yesterday, I had noticed that the handle was a bit loose. And it would only get more loose, faster, if it wasn't fixed now. It's a small thing, but one of my mantras recently has been "environment as treatment," and fixing this was a part of fixing my environment so it would fix me. A collection of thoughts supporting this:

[Strong design choices in common areas can help treat dementia symptoms](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/535311991) and reduce the need for medication. It it literally part of the healing process. We are constantly communicating with the objects and spaces around us, and those spaces [inform how we are able to communicate with each other](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/751184781).

An incredibly effective way to [change yourself is to change something in your space](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/446271372). If you want to walk more, put something you regularly use in another room. These habits - the paths we wear down - [shape our world and shape the habits of others that have to travel through our world](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/468479763).

And increasingly I feel we need to understand the environment as animate: [A bay is a noun only if water is dead](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/573688451) and treating the physical world as animate encourages us to shape and care for it. And, of course, [buildings learn and adapt](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/after-watching-how-buildings-learn): fighting for a building to stand perfectly suited for its first purpose (and remain that way) is a foolâ€™s errand. Building your own [relationship with the world around you is the only way to ensure that both survive](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/640100011), and this is what I want to focus on when I fix things: repairing the relationship, not just the thing.
