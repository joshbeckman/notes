This year's [Shopify Editions.dev](https://editions.dev/pages/editions-dev) conference was held on the final day of [Shopify Summit 2025](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/traveling/shopify-summit-2025) and I went across the street to Toronto's Automotive Building to meet and support Shopify's huge developer/partner ecosystem. It's a big event to promote the features in [Shopify Editions Summer '25](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/shopify-editions-summer-25) and gather feedback from the community.

I supported the same event [last year](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/traveling/shopify-summit-2024) but this year we had over twice the attendees! I was so pleasantly surprised to see some familiar faces from last year and even more thrilled to hear how excited the platform developers are for the new features. It's rewarding to build a software system that not only provides value to merchants but also provides a platform for developers to build _their_ businesses serving merchant niches.

## Flow Masterclass

This year, I volunteered to design and present a masterclass on [Flow](https://www.shopify.com/flow) as part of the event. It was a ~90min session where I outlined Flow's use cases, the new features in Editions '25, and then lead an hour-long live-coding session to demonstrate how to solve real-world merchant needs with Flow's new features.

It was exhausting, exhilarating, and very successful! We had all the seats filled in the ~150 person room, and - despite some WiFi/technical difficulties - most everyone stayed and was engaged in the material throughout the session.

And attendees really liked the masterclass!

I even got a callout in [this linkedin post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/circle-21st-edition-shop-circle-limsf/?trackingId=YbHROY34RLuZUNvS%2BGqgSw%3D%3D#:~:text=teams%2C%20including%20a-,standout,-session%20by%20Josh) afterward - in the same breath as _Harley_!

> First-hand insights from Shopifyâ€™s product, strategy, and partner teams, including a standout session by Josh Beckman and a keynote by Shopify President Harley Finkelstein.

**Note**: The presentation was recorded and will be uploaded to YouTube soon. I'll embed that here when it's live.
