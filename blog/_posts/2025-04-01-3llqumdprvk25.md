[jacksondahl.com/dialectic/cw...](https://jacksondahl.com/dialectic/cwandt) what an inspiring conversation - with [CW + T](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/cwt) on Dialectic with Jackson Dahl - for anyone who works creatively and especially for tinkerers like me. I jotted down so many notes listening to this (it introduced me to “form follows force” design methods).
