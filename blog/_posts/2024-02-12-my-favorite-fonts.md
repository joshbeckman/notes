I hate getting an `I` confused with an `l` confused with a `1` , so I usually favor serif fonts\. But, I have to admit that for user interfaces like websites \(with links and buttons and icons\), sans\-serif fonts work better\.

For [this site](/about-this-site) (and generally) I use [IBM Plex Sans](https://www.ibm.com/plex/), which I love because it’s open\-source and has a crossed `I` and disambiguated `l/1` _and_ disambiguated `0/O`\. The [Complete Guide to IBM Plex Sans on Beautiful Web Type](https://beautifulwebtype.com/ibm-plex-sans/) is a helpful/condensed walkthrough of its features.

> [!NOTE]
> An alternative that I've seen used and is _very_ close to this is to configure [the Inter font family](https://rsms.me/inter/) with the `ss02` font-feature (sets disambiguation for characters). I still prefer IBM Plex Sans where this is the default.

For monospace applications like displaying and working with tabular source code I use [Berkeley Mono](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/), which I love for much the same reasons and because it feels comfortable on my eyes\. It was the first font I’ve ever paid for, but I appreciate how much time the author has put into it and I do love how it looks\.

I used to prefer the [Libertinus font](https://github.com/alerque/libertinus) - because it is open\-source and has some lovely little flourishes - until I realized that sans-serif fonts look better for interfaces and have basically the same affordance for long-form text.

I used to think that loading custom fonts on a site was a waste of bandwidth, but I’ve come around to the idea that sites should all be personalized and I just actually think some fonts are better than others\.
