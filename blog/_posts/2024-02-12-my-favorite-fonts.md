I hate getting an `I` confused with an `l` confused with a `1` , so I usually favor serif fonts\. But, I have to admit that for user interfaces like websites \(with links and buttons and icons\), sans\-serif fonts work better\.

For \[this site\]\(/about\-this\-site\) and generally I use [IBM Plex Sans](https://www.ibm.com/plex/), which I love because it’s open\-source and has a crossed `I` and disambiguated `l/1` \.

For monospace applications like displaying and working with tabular source code I use [Berkeley Mono](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/), which I love for much the same reasons and because it feels comfortable on my eyes\. It was the first font I’ve ever paid for, but I appreciate how much time the author has put into it and I do love how it looks\.

For serif applications \(like book text\), I prefer the [Libertinus font](https://github.com/alerque/libertinus) because it is open\-source and has some lovely little flourishes\. I used to use this font everywhere until I realized that sans\-serif fonts looks better for interfaces\.

I used to think that loading custom fonts on a site was a waste of bandwidth, but I’ve come around to the idea that sites should all be personalized and I just actually think some fonts are better than others\.
