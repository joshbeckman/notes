In the same line as [Apple Music Replay 2024](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/listening/apple-music-replay-2024) and [Strava Year in Sport 2024](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/strava-year-in-sport-2024) I used [git-wrapped](https://git-wrapped.com/) to generate a 2024 review of my commits on [GitHub](https://github.com/joshbeckman/).

I'm pretty sure this only includes my public repository contributions (not my contributions for Shopify work). If it had, the contribution rate would be _much_ higher and my top language would be Ruby. Funny that my top day is still Wednesday, even for open-source work.

They also have a bug in calculating the "stars": I'm pretty sure it's including all-time stars, not just this year. 

But it's still a fun little lookback.
