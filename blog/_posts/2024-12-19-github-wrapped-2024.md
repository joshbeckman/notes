In the same line as [Apple Music Replay 2024](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/listening/apple-music-replay-2024) and [Strava Year in Sport 2024](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/strava-year-in-sport-2024) I used [git-wrapped](https://git-wrapped.com/) to generate a 2024 review of my commits on GitHub.

I'm pretty sure this only includes my public repository contributions (not my contributions for Shopify work). If it had, the contribution rate would be _much_ higher and my top language would be Ruby. Funny that my top day is still Wednesday, even for open-source work.

They also have a bug in calculating the "stars": I'm pretty sure it's including all-time stars, not just this year. 

But it's still a fun little lookback.
