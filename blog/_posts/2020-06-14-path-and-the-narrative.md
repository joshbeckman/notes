It is not enough to simply architect a system or solution. You must create a story, a path through it, from your current state to multiple end states. If you simply present a picture of end state, members do not know what to do to contribute. The _path and the narrative_ is the actual useful solution. Architecture or solution alone is an empty vessel.

> You can know what you are to do only if you also know what story you are a part of.
