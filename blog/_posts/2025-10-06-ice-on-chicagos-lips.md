Over the weekend, ICE and illegal federal raids were asked/talked about in most conversations. We haven't seen any in person, yet, but their disgusting actions are all over the news and there are helicopters overhead.

[Masked federal agents are teargassing street corners from their cars](https://dansinker.com/posts/2025-10-03-logan-square/) and plainclothes federal agents are walking into hospitals to detain residents without warrants (and then [handcuffing city representatives when they ask what they're doing](https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/10/03/federal-agents-handcuff-chicago-alderperson-who-tried-to-help-immigrant/)). They're [hiding in UHaul trucks to roll up on apartment buildings where they use stun grenades on sleeping families](https://bsky.app/profile/unraveledpress.com/post/3m23bq6qk7k26). They're [standing on the Magnificent Mile in full combat fatigues and helmets with assault rifles on a peaceful sunny day](https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/28/armed-federal-agents-patrol-millennium-park-mag-mile-to-chants-of-shame/) as citizens all around them chant "shame, shame."

Every conversation has the same sentiment, and you can see it in how the public is reacting to all these insults on our home and rights: this is terrible, we are all angry, we will continue to resist, we will not be cowed by this.
