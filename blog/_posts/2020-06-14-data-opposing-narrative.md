Often, people who donâ€™t have access to the raw data expect one narrative to be drawn from data analysis. But the analysts actually in the data know that there are always many, many narratives in the data. Data is often opposite a single narrative. The narratives coming from the data are also never closed or complete, as data continuously arrives. But people want and attach themselves to a single narrative.
