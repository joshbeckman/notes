After starting at and helping to start companies multiple times, I’ve noticed a few writings and lectures that I tend to revisit each time. Even when not moving to a new group, I tend to watch or read these every few months. The beginning of this list came out of a question from the wonderful [Jane Kim](https://twitter.com/happygeometry).

I read [Ray Dalio’s Principles](https://www.principles.com) (which are conveniently located online, now) to remind myself of the unapologetic beauty of truth in action and truth in words. The pamphlet is a bit heavy-handed with the imperative advice, but I find it compelling nonetheless.

I watch [Laura Savino speak about the power of words](https://vimeo.com/112107650) and think about choosing the right words for how I want to interact with others. Increasingly, I catch myself nearly using a word that connotes more or less than I mean. Taking moments to think of better words, and watching people react to exact words, has been enlightening. It’s also spurred a desire to learn more languages.

I watch [Bret Victor speak about invention-based mindsets](https://vimeo.com/36579366) and think about challenging implicit beliefs and biases. More than just challenging bias, it’s about defining what _exactly_ could be better built into our mindset, or better pulled out of it. He makes a call to _widen the gap_ identified by Ira Glass (below), and _widen human capabilities_.

I peruse code I have released in the past year and find the worst piece. I think about how, exactly, I would make it better now, or how to avoid it completely. I go back through my code and find the piece that had the most positive impact and think about why, exactly, it had that impact. Those two pieces are _not_ mutually exclusive, but I hope they are.

I read [Valve’s Handbook for New Employees](http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf) as the most organic and captivating on-boarding document I have even encountered. It’s a fantastic bundle of rules and history brimming with hidden gems. I read [Netflix’s Culture Deck](http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664) as the most idealistic version of a workplace guide. It has influenced most of my workplaces, directly or indirectly.

I watch and listen to [Sarah Kay captivate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snNB1yS3IE) with perfect timing, pure enthusiasm, and plenty of emotion. Her first poem is a near-perfect piece of performance, in my opinion. It reminds me that delivery is immensely important to the success of your message.

I listen to [Ira Glass talk about the gap while creating](https://vimeo.com/85040589) and think about the importance of maintaining that gap. In my experience, a great swath of developers and tech workers allow that gap to close very quickly; meeting their own expectations and readily defending their work as the best possible. I remind myself that better work should always extend my grasp and I should know where to find it.
