Just like [my Apple Music year-in-review](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/listening/apple-music-replay-2025), [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/beckman_josh) wants to give me an annual aggregation before the year is done. But here are their highlights:

## Top Sports

![Top sports](/assets/images/c5c47d20-6937-413e-b7ca-3ea1735c1dac.jpeg)

- 128hr 12min of weight lifting
- 316mi of running
- 26hr of general workouts (e.g. "Basketball" and "Physical Therapy")
- 45mi of hiking
- 64mi of biking

Again (as [I said in my 2024 review](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/strava-year-in-sport-2024)), I feel like the hiking is undercounted here. I thought I hiked at least 45mi on [the Grand Canyon trip](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/traveling/hiking-the-grand-canyon-royal-arch-loop) _alone_?

![Top running segment](/assets/images/3a51b56a-6418-4c5b-854d-8f129e12ce0d.jpeg)

My top running segment was the Willow St. sprint: I ran it 42 times.

You'll notice that *Walking* isn't on that last. After [I ditched the Apple Watch for a Garmin](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/buttons-are-for-doing-exchanging-the-apple-watch-ultra), I stopped tracking my general commutes/walking activities. I'm biking much more because I started playing basketball and biking to that.

## Social

![Social kudos](/assets/images/74ec4124-037e-40db-aa48-126fa7854a4b.jpeg)

Increasingly, I appreciate Strava as a social community, focused on sport. I rediscovered an old friend - now across the country - on Strava, but Ned is still my biggest "fan" on the platform.

## Active Time

![Streak of active weeks](/assets/images/324ed0c9-f2ed-447e-90c5-ea2ec05c64ea.jpeg)

I'm still on a streak of working out at least once each week, now at 189 weeks (top 0.8% on Strava).

![Active days](/assets/images/8bfa4f9b-5b32-4288-9700-fc9695b93df8.jpeg)

I've been active for 286 days in 2025 (top 4% on Strava). August was the most active, with 29 days.

![Active hours](/assets/images/0b812186-7cf6-4dfd-a741-e14dab3eee2f.jpeg)

I've been active for 230hr in 2025 (top 6% on Strava). April was the most active, with 35hr.

## Personal Records

![Trophy case](/assets/images/a41d01f9-8d2d-48af-81ae-3b582a38b0d4.jpeg)

I set new personal records (for the past couple years of tracking on Strava) in:
- 5K: 21:47
- 10K: 53:16
- 10mi: 1:34:28

I was definitely faster in my youth, but it's good to see my speed picking up as I've run more this year.

## Comparison

> [!NOTE]
> You can read my full [Strava Year in Sport from last year](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/strava-year-in-sport-2024). In reviewing it, I remembered I had wanted to make my _own_ dedicated stats page (so I don't have to wait for Strava's annual review). I've made that at my [Exercise Stats](https://www.joshbeckman.org/exercise/stats) page, which is updated daily.

Activity Changes

| Metric           | 2024       | 2025        | Change |
|------------------|------------|-------------|--------|
| Weight Training  | 77hr 22min | 128hr 12min | +66%   |
| Running          | 232mi      | 316mi       | +36%   |
| Hiking           | 25mi       | 45mi        | +80%   |
| General Workouts | 9hr        | 26hr        | +189%  |
| Active Days      | 305 days   | 286 days    | -6%    |
| Active Hours     | 171hr      | 230hr       | +35%   |

Starting to regularly play basketball increased both my biking miles and my general active hours, I think. Unfortunately, it also brought a couple new injuries and so now I'm in [regular physical therapy](https://www.joshbeckman.org/search/?q=%22physical%20therapy%22) for a bit of recovery. I'm hoping to start 2026 healthy and with no pain.
