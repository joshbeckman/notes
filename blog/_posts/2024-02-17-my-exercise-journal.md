I was reading [this blog post](https://2ndbreakfast.audreywatters.com/the-case-for-a-paper-journal/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) about how and why this professional runner likes keeping a plain paper notebook for a weight\-lifting and running journal\. It got me thinking: I’ve fallen into something like this over the last few months\.

Not writing things down in paper, but keeping a journal of my exercise\. I keep mine in my digital journal, where I can include photos and attach date/location stamp stuff\. I used to keep a paper weightlifting journal in high school \(because we didn’t have phones everywhere\)\. But I prefer the digital medium because I can include photos and because my hands shake too much \(when I’m really lifting weights\) to write clearly\.

I’ve been using a digital app to *plan* my weightlifting for over a year now\. And I record my runs with a heart\-rate\-monitoring Apple Watch\. But over the last couple months I’ve semi\-consciously started keeping this journal alongside it, recording how I felt during the session, writing down what I listened to or thought about\. Attaching a photo or two of the local dogs I see\. It has felt good to recognize myself as doing more than hitting numbers in my workouts\.

And I look forward to finding these in a year \- it’ll be much more valuable and enjoyable to me than it is to just review the numbers\.
