I'm away, hiking, scrambling, and breathing in California this week with my good friend John. But I have half an hour before another night hike, so here are some vignettes.

<figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row">

More to come.

By the way, I'm experimenting here with these posts about my travel only being sent to family members on this newsletter. You can also see it online if you're subscribed, and I'll be publishing a bit more for you than for the general public.

(On a hike, John asked me if I have social media accounts, and I don't; I have this.)
