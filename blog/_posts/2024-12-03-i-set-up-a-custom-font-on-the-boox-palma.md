This morning I figured out how to set up my preferred font \(IBM Plex Sans\) on the Boox Palma\! I had to use their Boox Drop app \(websites accessible on LAN are still amazing\) and upload the font files from my computer, but now I’ve got it working like a charm\.

I’m kinda loving the hackability of this little Android device\!
