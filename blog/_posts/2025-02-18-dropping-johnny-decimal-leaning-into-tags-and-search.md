I am dropping the use of the [Johnny Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com) categorization framework on this site. For just over a year, I [used it to govern and organize the tags](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/about-the-index) used between the posts and pages here.

I found the decimal system too restrictive and better suited for physical, 2D space. It was, after all, built for and modeled on a physical filing system where everything would have a single place. I'm operating this site as a digital, multidimensional space that I want to optimize for networking between posts - I want more [triadic closure](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/465072858). Tags are a better taxonomy for that: they overlap and every post can occupy space in more than one. I also want to lean in to making new tags for more complex/multifaceted topics like individual persons.

Similarly, I've dropped the reliance on the old site index (and source/date indices) in favor of search (via attributes: tags, date, author, source, etc.). It's still accessible; it just lists the tags. Things won't be as "browsable" but they are now _much_ more "discoverable" and "navigable" and generally linked together. Posts still have links to their siblings by source/date/etc. but it's now powered by the search page alone. I think this better leverages the actual organization/information attached to each, while actually _encouraging_ more exploration.

## Future

Soon, I want to use LLMs to help me find the blind spots in my tagged network. I want to build:
- an LLM bot to add tags to my old posts (especially when a new tag is created)
- an LLM bot that identifies low-usage tags and suggests removing it
