Another good reason to begin [documenting your Theory of The Program](https://www.joshbeckman.org/2020/07/12/on-theory-building-as-an-engineering-team/): it’s a way to combat [the death of the author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author). If you have explicitly written down the intentions of some software, and what it assumed, then others cannot add assumptions onto you in the future. You are also forced into honesty about what you initially considered and how you perceived the world.
