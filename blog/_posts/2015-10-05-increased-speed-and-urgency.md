From Jack Dorsey’s re-introduction as CEO of Twitter today:

> My focus is to build teams that move fast, and learn faster. In the past 3 months we have increased our speed and urgency at both companies.[October 5, 2015](https://twitter.com/jack/status/651003529444765696)

It seems strange to desire increased urgency on your team. This brings me back to some thoughts I’ve been writing down about different types of _fuel powering your work_. I need to compile them all together.

A sense of urgency or stress is definitely on my list, but I also have it earmarked as one that rapidly depletes you in the end game.
