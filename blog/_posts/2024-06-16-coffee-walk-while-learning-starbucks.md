As I listened to Howard Schultz talk about how Starbucks is the third place and how the experience of buying a handmade coffee is what the company is all about, I think about why I prefer these places over Starbucks. I don’t think I’ve ever had that experience at their stores. I believe that it’s what he dreams of, though.
