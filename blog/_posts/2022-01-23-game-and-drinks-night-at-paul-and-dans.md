## Drink Game
The rules:
- Everyone is randomly assigned a partner
- Everyone goes to the liquor cabinet and chooses a bottle of something that they think compliments their partner and explains why
- That person then has to find/invent a cocktail recipe using that ingredient, and makes enough portions for everyone to try

Then, after/as we taste them all, we judge a winner based on voting/criteria:
- Efficiency
- Presentation
- Taste
- Context
- "It" factor

Dan was given a rare sherry by Marybeth\. He made some passion fruit sherry drink I can’t remember\. I think based on a Lost Lake\.\.\.
