I was invited onto the _Never Rewrite_ podcast last week to talk about... when and why I think you should rewrite software.

In the episode, I talked with Isaac and Jeffrey about how I organized the rewrite of [OfficeLuv](https://officeluv.com)'s [micro-service architecture](https://microservices.io) into a speedy and stable [monolith](https://microservices.io/patterns/monolithic.html). The whole idea behind their podcast series is that rewriting a big software project is fraught with failures and that you _shouldn't_ do it - and they were gracious enough to bring me on to talk about how it _can_ be done well!

The episode is available as audio:

Or video, where you can see me gesture too much for a podcast recording:
