This leaf fell off the fiddle\-leaf fig last week and I kept it around\. I then figured I could fit it into an 8x10” frame I had laying around, and so I then put a simple paper behind it and hung it up\.
What’s interesting is that, originally, the leaf was ​*all green*​, and since I’ve hung it up, the veins have started to yellow and then brown, spreading out more every day\.
So now this framed image is changing daily, living and growing still, separated from the root\.
