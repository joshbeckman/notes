I come back to [COLOR](https://vimeo.com/33998046) by Tom Sachs whenever I want to force myself into an artistic decision.

It tells me: take a stance on the infinite spectrum of artistic choice, commit, and defend your reasons. They're as good as any others.

This time, I realized that I haven't seen these colors (the static set they use in their studio) written out online. I think Sachs might hate these being reduced to hex codes, so I'm going to do it here.

Most of the colors in the film are only described as a reference to a paint or brand color; I've done the best I can to get an accurate hex code.

| Color | Reference | Hex | Image |

| White | Benjamin Moore's Decorator's White | `#EBEDEA` | ![white](https://www.thecolorapi.com/id?format=svg&named=false&hex=ebedea) |

If you have a better reference for any of these, please send it my way and I'll update this list.
