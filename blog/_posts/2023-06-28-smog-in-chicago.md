Chicago had the worst air quality in the nation today.   
  
Walking outside smelled like stinky ash. And the air was hard to breathe, causing us to cough. The sunlight had an eerie yellow tinge, even at noon as I took these photos over lunch while holding my breath in our patio.

We wore our N95 masks while walking to the theater and then took them off once inside for the movie. It was a surreal reversal of our routines for COVID - still having a mask dangling out of my back pocket but for very different reasons.
