I've been a *long* time customer of Parabo Press for all my wall art photography prints. I've especially loved their large engineer prints, but I've also extensively printed with their matte fine-art printing. But recently, they've significantly increased their prices, while I have also been wanting to actually print *more* for others in my life.

So I'm trying out a couple other photo labs after doing a bit of research.

| Lab | Price for 8"x10" matte photo rag print |
|-----|----------------------------------------|
| [Parabo Press](https://www.parabo.press/) | $30 |
| [mpix](https://www.mpix.com/) | $6 |
| [Nations Photo Lab](https://www.nationsphotolab.com/) | $5 |
| [Whitewall](https://www.whitewall.com/us) | $32 |

So, I've selected a varied set of prints that I'm getting printed at both mpix and Nations this week and then I'll compare them to Parabo's on my wall and see if I can save money by going with a different printer. I didn't send to Whitewall because they're more expensive even than what I've been using previously, though they definitely have the most options and seem to have the highest quality. They're good to know about in the future in case I want that.

I chose photos that I want a copy of and I will send the other copies to loved ones, hoping to make their day.
