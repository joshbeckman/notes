> TLDR: email me at josh at joshbeckman.org

To better open my experience and privilege as a resource for others, I wanted to take some time to explicitly write down the ways I’m available to help folks on the internet that I don’t already know. This is an initial list that will probably grow, shrink, and change over time. This post and some of the wording in it was heavily inspired by [Will Larson](https://lethain.com/ways-i-help/)’s post on the same topic.

I generally prefer email as a medium for these communications, especially in our initial conversation(s). So if you tweet at me or send a LinkedIn message, don’t expect a [quick] reply.

Note that I am a self-taught, white, straight, cis-gender man without a disability. I will try to:

- Not give advice on things I haven’t directly experienced
- Not generalize my experiences
- Be explicit about when my privilege has helped me and may not help others with different circumstances

That said, ways I’m available to help anyone:

- **Answer direct question about topics I know about**. I really try to answer every concise question I get over email. The more specific, the easier it will be to get an answer for you. If you write a two to four paragraph email with a clear question, I will try to answer it in a timely fashion. Topics that I can answer about quickly are generally anything I’ve [written]( /) or [presented](https://ghpages.joshbeckman.org/presents/) about or [worked on](https://github.com/andjosh). Reach out to me at _josh[at]joshbeckman.org_.

Ways I’m available to help BIPOC and women in tech:

- **Interview advice and practice**. I’ve interviewed _many_ people at early- and mid-stage startups for years, so I can help you in situations like that. I am very happy to help practice interviews with you or give you advice on how to best approach different interview structures or scenarios.
- **Mid-career job advice**. After your first tech position, you really start getting a handle on how wide the world of tech can be. I’m eager to help people figure out the differences in those multiple paths and can share my own experience as a data point to inform your own.
- **Startup tech evaluations**. Many times people in tech are presented with existing or proposed towers of technical debt when they join a company. I am happy to help evaluate the soundness of those environments or decisions, in a limited capacity.
- **Review blog posts or talk proposals**. I want to see more writing from everyone in tech, but would be happiest to see those from BIPOC. Any help I can give in bringing your voice to the fore I will give. I’m not the best proofreader, but can help shape ideas and identify those that would be most interesting to others.

Some things I’m _not_ a good resource for:

- **Getting your first job in tech**. My own career path into and through tech was not traditional (or, I think, replicable). I also don’t have the best grasp on the environments many bootcamps provide, so I will leave the advice for first jobs to those just leaving their first job. Go find those people!
- **Getting hired at Big Tech companies**. Until recently, I’ve only ever worked for small to mid-size startups, where I was able to control the vast majority of the hiring process, so I don’t have any advice that you couldn’t discover yourself through Google searches.
- **Referrals that are unlikely to get serious consideration**. This may be the wrong stance, but I only refer people of make an introduction if I am exceedingly confident that both parties will strongly engage. That usually means I won’t do it, and I save my sponsorship efforts for those individuals I already know.
- **Connecting with you on LinkedIn**. I prefer having my LinkedIn profile represent my actual network. This is so when people ask me for introductions, I genuinely know the people they’re asking about. To that end, I generally don’t accept connection requests from people I haven’t met in person, or haven’t talked to extensively through email.

These lists aren’t comprehensive, but I hope by being explicit about what I’m available to do then folks will feel more comfortable reaching out, For anything that isn’t covered, writing a concise email to inquire is the best route!
