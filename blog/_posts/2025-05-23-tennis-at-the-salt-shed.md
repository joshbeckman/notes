Paul and Dan pulled me in to go see [Tennis](https://tennis-music.com/) perform at the Salt Shed on their farewell tour. We got close to the stage and the whole evening felt intimate. [Billie Marten](https://www.billiemarten.com/) opened for them and she was ethereal. When Tennis took the stage, they settled into a groove and never left it.
