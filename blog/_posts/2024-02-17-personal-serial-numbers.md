I was listening to [Van Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5mPJA4y5G8Z6aNkY6AxgAw) yesterday and he mentioned a habit of adding serial numbers to pieces he builds\. I like that \- a fun little stamp on an item that gives it a name all its own\. As a complement to version numbers \(which should follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) format\) which identify the model used for a build, a serial number to identify *that specific instance* of a build is useful\.

I like the format that Tom Sachs \(and some other\) artists take of incorporating the year into a format of `YYYY.###` which results in something like `2024.023` for the twenty\-third item made in twenty\-twenty\-four\.

But I’d want a serial number to also identify *the model* in addition to the year and counter\. Something like `YYYY.SSS.###` where `SSS` is the model or series identifier\. A uniq three\-letter code that identifies the series or model being counted\. This would result in something like `2024.DSK.003` for the third desk I built in twenty\-twenty\-four\. Really, the “counter” doesn’t have to actually be a counter, it just has to be unique in the year\. Counting is just an easy way for humans to generate a unique identifier for a thing\.

Where could I start using this to give handles to things I’m making? I guess the serial number is most useful for *physical* items that must be made and can’t be copied easily\. The version number is most useful for *digital knowledge* \(like code\) that are replicated and destroyed infinitely\.

I guess I’ve been using a serial numbering system \(implicitly\) for years in my cameras: they each have their own file naming pattern for each photo that tries to mimic a serial numbering scheme\. I should lean into that\! I should go edit them to conform to a common serial pattern for easier sorting/identification/etc\.

*Update:* I'm realizing that this is similar to how I have [the site index](/notes/about-the-index) under the [Johnny.Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/) system.
