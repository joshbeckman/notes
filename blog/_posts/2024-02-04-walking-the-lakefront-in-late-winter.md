I love walking in Chicago, and the lakefront is the best place to do it\. I’ve fallen behind in my own [ice watch](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/478410758) this year, but I had an open afternoon today so I walked a good six miles in hazy sunshine\.

The ice is barely there, but it’s tucked into nooks and crannies at the edges of anything wet\.

Late winter is one of my favorite times to walk in Chicago\. Every resident is bursting out on any sunny day \- ready to soak in whatever the sun will provide\.
