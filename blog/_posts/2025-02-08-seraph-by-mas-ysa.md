[Noah Kalina](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/hotline-show-by-noah-kalina) recommended this album when [the artist called in to a recent show](https://youtu.be/TibVL8wTusk?si=qJ7TJnAbN50ukF0b&t=1199). It sounds like someone grappling with past relationships and habitual late nights in the city by making synth and sample music. Great for playing loud in your New York studio apartment on a rainy night.

Favorite track: Arrows
