I have been writing my movie reviews on my personal site but I doubt anyone is reading them\. Instead, I need to make sure they publish somewhere that people will read them\. I *want* people to engage with them, after all\.

So, I need to either POSSE \(syndicate\) *into* another space where people will engage with it or PESOS \(archive\) into my personal site, *out of* that space after publishing it there for other people\.

I already do this, for example, in my open source software habits: [I use GitHub](https://github.com/joshbeckman) to work in the open and publish software packages\. And I highlight/archive things here on my own site \(well, not everything\. I need to get on that \- make it complete\)\. I do that because GitHub is ​*where the developers are*​\.

For social networks, I am syndicating my writing here [into Mastodon](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/how-to-crosspost-to-mastodon-with-jekyll) and [into Bluesky](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/crossposting-to-bluesky-from-jekyll) \(until one of them wins or the other withers\)\.

For my movie log, I think I need to start using [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/joshbeckman/) \- it’s ​*where the movie watchers are \(my friends who are movie watchers\)*​\. That system doesn’t have an API where I can *syndicate* my posts from here to there, but it does have a personal feed where I can *archive* my posts from there to here\. So I think I gotta go build that\.

You need to publish where the people are reading\. If that place has an API to publish, POSSE \(syndicate\) to it\. If it only has an API to read/subscribe, PESOS \(archive\) from it\. If it has neither, don’t use it: just publish on your own\.
