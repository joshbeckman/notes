My grandma found an old tiny camera in her basement that wasn't working and asked me if I would use it. This isn't the first time this has happened - I think I've gotten three other cameras this way.

This one turned out to be a cute little [Olympus XA2](https://casualphotophile.com/2023/05/23/olympus-xa2-point-and-shoot-35mm-film-camera-review/). After a bit of cleaning and some new batteries, I had it working again.

I have various film stock in my fridge that I've had since I shot film more regularly in college and my early 20s. (I used to have a little [Olympus 35RC](https://www.kenrockwell.com/olympus/35rc.htm) that I _adored_ and then lost somehow.) I grabbed some fridge-preserved SAF 400 film (I remember this being the most budget film I could find in college) that must be long expired and put it through the XA2 when friends came over these past winter nights.

These were developed by [Bellows](https://www.bellowsfilmlab.com/) (down the street) and scanned with their  Noritsu HS-1800 scanner.

I have another roll of the same film, and I think I'll over-expose it half a stop - try to clean up the grain a bit. I also need to remember to set the focal distance, as there were a lot _just_ out of focus (it resets every time you close the camera). I'm interested to use it outside without a flash and see how that goes.
