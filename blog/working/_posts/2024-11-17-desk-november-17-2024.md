I got annoyed with the Elegato Key Lights being slow to turn on and requiring my computer to operate them\. So I gave them to some coworkers and instead bought my own basic LED bulbs and put them in basic work lights and then hooked them up to a foot/floor switch extension cord\. So now there’s no software and I can just stomp on the floor switch to turn the lights on and off\. It’s gloriously simple and reliable\.

I also got annoyed with the USB cord for my keyboard snaking its way under my notebook and generally getting in the way\. So I drilled a hole in the desktop and now it’s snaking down and out of sight back up to the monitor\.
