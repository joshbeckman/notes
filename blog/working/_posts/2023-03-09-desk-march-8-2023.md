I've slightly rotated the monitor so that I can have a deeper front space to lean into meetings. It also allows me to have a deeper workspace for construction projects out of working hours.

Books on the desk:

- _[A Psalm for The Wild-Built]( /after-reading-a-psalm-for/)_
- _The Creative Act_
- _[Kissa by Kissa]( /after-reading-kissa-by-kissa/)_
- _Visual Explanations_
