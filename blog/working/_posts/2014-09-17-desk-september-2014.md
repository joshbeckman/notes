Since there's a bunch of space on the Aggrego floor these days, I've taken a corner office.

There's no actual place to stand and work in here, though, so I've taken a garbage can and turned it upside down to hold up my laptop.

Can't beat that view, though.

This desk is basically an MDF conference room table, pushed against the window and radiator. I work in here by myself half the time, and the other half I spend at other people's desks.
