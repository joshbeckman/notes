I've installed a series of LED grow lights in the old cabinet to support the menagerie of plants I had staged around the house in a more supportive environment.

I've ditched the iPad and gone back to taking notes with pencil and paper because there's nothing to 'wake up' or 'open' or 'get used to' and I never shared anything I drew on the iPad anyway.

Bant sometimes asks for a leg up onto the empty space.
