I've moved all my tools to custom shelving I built behind me and I put up some new photo prints from our summer trip to Europe.

Books on the desk:

- _[The Design of Everyday Things]( /after-reading-the-design-of-everyday-things/)_
- _[Kissa by Kissa]( /after-reading-kissa-by-kissa/)_
- _Visual Explanations_
