I wanted a bit more green on my desk, so I built a terrarium.

I had seen this hand-blown glass and wood bowl stand combo thing at a local shop. I waited until I could go to the local garden shop, [Sprout](https://sprouthome.com/), where I picked up a handful of ferns and vines.

Then, I collected some moss and rocks from around the block and put them all together in a pleasing arrangement one night. I'm pretty pleased!
