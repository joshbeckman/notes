You can see the mouse is back on the table. I have been living in Google Docs at work and the lack of accessible handles in that UI for my keyboard hands finally broke me.

I've also grown tired of turning my neck between two monitors, so I've collapsed my laptop and now I can use the tray to hold my iPad during the workday. This lets me jot personal reminders and check personal email easily.

I've also moved the air purifier onto my desk. Previously, it was sitting in a closet and I figured it should at least do some good.
