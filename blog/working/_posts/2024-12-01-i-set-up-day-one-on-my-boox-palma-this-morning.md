And also connected my mechanical keyboard to the device via bluetooth\. I'm thinking this might be a fun way to journal and draft things away from other distractions and maybe outside in the sun\.

Though, it's freezing outside this morning, so maybe not outside for a while\.

I got inspired to do this as I was browsing my phone in bed this morning and came across this digital typewriter thing that was basically just a mechanical keyboard and an e\-ink screen and was selling for like $500 and I realized that I could make basically the same thing with this tiny e\-ink screen and [my mechanical keyboard that I already like](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/shopify-keychron-k3-pro)\.

I'm using Day One for this and not some dedicated drafting app because I don't like the idea of having to copy over posts/writing from one place to another to access or share them\.

Writing on here isn't the *best* thing but it's fun and definitely gets my creative juices flowing\. And I just *love* writing/reading text on this e\-ink display \- the facsimile of paper and ink for text is just always better than pixels\.

The only big deficiency I'm noticing is that the font in the Android version of Day One is not configurable in the app\. It has to be configured system\-wide and there are only a couple options \- none of which are monospace \(which I would like for this e\-ink display\)\.Â  And the key bindings on Android are a bit wonky \- but maybe that will encourage me to *simply* write in here and not edit too much?
