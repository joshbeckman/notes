![My current desk against the wall](/assets/images/60aa1d9c-c463-4df8-8272-6b003f32e303.jpeg)

I've made my own video light with a work-light, simple bulb, and parchment paper as a diffuser. It's working well! Way cheaper, brighter, more reliable, and more flattering than any previous computer-aided video light. I recommend making your own.

Yesterday I cut more wood blocks to raise my monitor higher (by about 6"). I've been [starting physical therapy](https://www.joshbeckman.org/search/?q=%22physical%20therapy%22) for my shoulder (and heel), and I have a sinking suspicion that my shoulder weakened [when I switched my desk to this wall](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/working/desk-july-9th-2025). I think it's because the monitor was lowered a bit (I didn't want to cover up my print of John smiling in Death Valley) and it's been encouraging me to hunch over while working, putting more stress on my shoulder and bending my back. Let's hope this helps, along with the therapy.
