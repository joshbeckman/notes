I destroyed the upcycled growing/garden cabinet in favor of a hydroponic garden (not pictured, out of view). I've moved all the plants to supportive windows or the outdoor garden itself.

This freed up space to get posters on the wall - starting with the official biking map of Chicago.

I also got started with synthesizers - that's an OP-Z on the table, trying to use it daily.
