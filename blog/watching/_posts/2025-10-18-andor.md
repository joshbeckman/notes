We watched the final episodes of _Andor_ on [the day that we protested a real-life authoritarian government](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/no-kings-protest-chicago-20251018). This show is a protest show. 

What got me to watch the show was friends saying, "It's not a Star Wars show. It's a great drama set in a Star Wars locale." And I enjoyed it as an espionage drama. The writing was at its best when it turned a face in the crowd into a character through an inspiring speech, and only suffered when the pacing lagged.

I think the show realized, as it wound up, that Luthen was the most interesting character it had found, and the growing focus on him pulled all my interest. Stellan Skarsg√•rd has a captivating voice.

I don't know if I'll come back to this show, but it's really got me thinking and talking with friends about styles of resistance and whether accelerationism is the right path under rule. That was worth it for me.
