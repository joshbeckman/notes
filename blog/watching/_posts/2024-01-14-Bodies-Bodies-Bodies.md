We watched this in the deep cold of Winter, so the hurricane aspect felt a bit foreign. The whole movie was so saturated and dark that it was hard to discern the plot at times. If you're going to have the movie get that dark, you can't _stay_ in that dark the whole time, or the nuance is lost and the darkness no longer feels scary.

The plot was decent, but I felt the twist coming. Hearing teenager dialogue (pretty accurately written) constantly also was a bit exhausting.
