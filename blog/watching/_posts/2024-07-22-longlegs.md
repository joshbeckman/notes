Matt and Brandon and I were pretty excited to see this movie - the trailer was a perfect blend of unease and flickering reference to plot/scare without actually revealing anything at all.

Unfortunately, the full movie was just like the trailer: mostly just unease with flickers of scare. I wanted more from the film: more from the ending, more development of characters, more scare and fewer long shots of heavy breathing. 

I think one main problem here is that it's difficult to match procedural crime and detective work to supernatural horror. The audience spends most of the movie trying to solve the problem and play by the rules and the rest of the movie just doesn't care; snapping its fingers it disappears in thin air.
