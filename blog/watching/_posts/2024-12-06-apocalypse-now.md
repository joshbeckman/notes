A man broken by war rides a boat of soldiers up a river to kill another man broken by war\. In the process, all of his companions are killed, and they kill hundreds of innocent people they see on the way\.

I sat down to watching this and had meant to do some craft work with my hands while watching\. I was unable to get anything done\. I was too riveted: stressed, horrified, waiting for resolution\. There isn’t resolution in the movie, and I think that’s the point\. It mirrors the Vietnam War itself: terroristic, schizophrenic, unresolved\.

​**Edit**​: After I wrote that, I found this:
> My film is not about Vietnam\. It is Vietnam\. It’s what it was really like\. It was crazy\. And the way we made it was very much like the way the Americans were in Vietnam\. We were in the jungle\. There were too many of us\. We had access to too much money, too much equipment, and little by little, we went insane\.<br/>[Francis Ford Coppala at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Apocalypse_Now#About)
