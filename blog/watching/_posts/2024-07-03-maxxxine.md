I love this trio of movies, but I place this third in line: *Pearl* was the best, and *X* was great as a breakout.

This one still has fantastic performances - Mia Goth, as always, never letting your attention go - and Kevin Bacon fried me - but I think the ending left me wanting a bit more. I did love the mystery throughout, and maybe a rewatch will raise it up for me.
