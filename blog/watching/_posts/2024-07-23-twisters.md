We went to see this up north of the city so that we could site back in front of a _real_ IMAX screen and soak in the weather FX. Beforehand, we at at Buffalo Wild Wings (my first time in over a decade), so it was really a BWWisters night.

The movie hit _all_ the tropes. It had so many moments that struck me as "Spielberg shots" - like where the camera rises from the ground as a little girl misses a baseball pitch because she notices the tornado behind her dad. The plot was predictable, the quotes were tropes, there were so many needle drops.

But it was unmistakably fun. I enjoyed it and it was exciting - a good story told.
