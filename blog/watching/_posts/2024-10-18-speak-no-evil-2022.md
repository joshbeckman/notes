I thought this was decently unsettling, but ultimately I felt like the [real] world it was trying to show me was broken by the unconvincing final actions of the main characters. It _did_ kind of feel like those dinner parties with friends-of-friends that slowly veer further and further away from acceptable but you still stay to eat. But I felt that the intensity of the final scenes were out of sync with the rest of the story.
