These are the short films we watched at this year's annual [Chicago Horror Film Festival](https://www.chicagohorrorfilmfest.com) that didn't have an IMDB/Letterboxd entry:

- Eye Candy
- [Denti](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32360984/)
  - This was a good idea I could see expanded into a feature.
- No Escape
- Midnight Movie
  - I could _not_ follow this one.
- Over The Shoulder
- Hell From the Shadows
- Spin The Bottle
- Mother_Mary
- Influence
- Bruja
- Isora
- Black Fog
- What Emmy Saw
- Toxemia
- Flesh and Blood
  - I liked the premise of this more than most.
- Heartworm
- Archaic
- Hello Killer
- Do You Live Here?
- Not Like Other Girls
  - I liked the execution of this idea, even though I couldn't stand watching the characters.

Others we watched:
- [Alice and the Little Green Men](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/letterboxd-review-891734149-alice-and-the-little-green-men)
- [Vampire Zombies...from Space!](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/letterboxd-review-891726006-vampire-zombiesfrom-space)

This was my second year attending, and I'll keep coming back for as much fun as it is.
