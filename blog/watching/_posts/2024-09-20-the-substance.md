I want to give this movie six stars out of five. I've been imploring everyone who can handle it that they must go see it and bask in its glory.

This movie stretches what is possible to convey in a film. The sounds. The sights. The horrors we do to ourselves [in pursuit of youth](https://www.joshbeckman.org/notes/633923153).  The horror of pop culture beauty. I felt the director condemn herself and at the same time long for herself, and I felt the same condemnation and love.

I went to go see it a second time and it was still fantastic. I made a shirt to wear to the second viewing:
