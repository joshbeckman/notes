I loved every second of him on the screen. Fred MacMurray's lines had me reeling, finding the base of every film noir trope I've ever heard. Barbara Stanwyck was ruthless and sultry throughout and sold it. All in all, I think this is probably a <em>very</em> good film.</p><p>BUT</p><p>It's incredibly hard to tell because I had possibly the worst movie-going experience ever. The film was shown in 35mm and one of the projectors had a bulb go out in the first change-over, so that the projectionist had to reload reels onto the single projector. This caused a 3-5min downtime every ~20min. Apparently that emboldened the people around me to talk louder and louder every change and others to start using their phones on full brightness. And <em>that</em> caused people to start arguing across rows, across my lap. Also, the projectionist mistakenly played one of the reels out of order for ~15min before realizing and having to reset backward a reel. So I watched this movie in broken 20min segments, a bit of it repeatedly, and with mounting displeasure.</p><p>But I still think it's a good movie.</p>
