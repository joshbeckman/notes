I’ve watched [videos from Andrew Callaghan](https://www.youtube.com/@Channel5YouTube) for years because I think he reports on the edges of society impartially\. I live a bit of my old journalism life vicariously through his work\. I support his work financially, though I don’t always recommend it for others\. It is really intense and forces you to confront other lives that most people avoid thinking about\. 

Because I’ve seen so much from him, I held back on watching his feature length film for a long time\. I guess I didn’t want to stare too long at the scene\. But after listening to [a long interview with him about his past](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEou104m_P0), I was reminded of the film and found an evening to watch it\. I don’t regret it\.
