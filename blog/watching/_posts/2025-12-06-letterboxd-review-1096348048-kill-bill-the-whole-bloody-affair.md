If you don't have the time for all of the hours, just watch <em>Vol. 1</em>.</p><p>I hadn't seen these stories in a few years, and they hold up so beautifully well.</p><p>Notes I scribbled on paper during this beautiful showing:</p><blockquote><p>The gorgeous colors!</p></blockquote><p>The super saturation of the beginning scenes slapped me in the face and I loved it. The various framing changes (16:9 to 4:3) and coloring changes (monotone to muted to saturated) throughout the chapters all just work so well.</p><blockquote><p>Watching this at a time when my wife will soon give birth to ourfirst child makes the coma wake-up scene hit incredibly hard.</p></blockquote><p>I didn't get <em>that</em> the first time I watched this.</p><blockquote><p>The perfection of diegetic music in this movie</p></blockquote><p>The music <em>really</em> struck me this time around. It's criminal that the full soundtrack is so hard to access.</p><blockquote><p>Diegetic framing?</p></blockquote><p>The shot of the sheriff looking at the bride through his green sunglasses which are then removed from the camera's view as he removes his sunglasses is a beautiful touch. What is this called? <em>Diegetic framing</em>? I want more of it in movies. (To be clear: this is not "splash mud on the camera lens" or "digitally add fake lens flare" like J.J. Abrams. I'm talking about the visual frame taking the perspective of the character momentarily.)</p><blockquote><p>The hyperbole of anime</p></blockquote><p>The breathtaking gory and beauty and angles in Oren's chapter were expanded and worthwhile in this edit.</p><blockquote><p>The pregnancy test scene!!</p></blockquote><p>I think the pregnancy test/discovery scene is utterly perfect. The pacing, the various camera angles, the dialogue, the comedy, the lighting. I think it should be released on its own as a short film and I'd love it.</p><p>All in all, the comedy surprised me this time around. I forgot how funny many of the scenes are: the sheriff's entrance, the sushi bar, there were so many laugh-out-loud moments that I had forgotten.</p><blockquote><p>The moto suit!!</p></blockquote><p>I think Kiddo's motorcycle suit might be my most coveted outfit in all of movies.</p>
