And I felt that while watching: atonement for the horrific effects of war and for the casual casting-out of anyone from society and for the compromise of your morals.</p><p>But I also felt the rising and overflowing happiness of caring for those you love and for the bond of childhood.</p><p>The image that twill remain with me: the lights of the fireflies rising and hovering and then fading into the lights of the firebombs dropping from warplanes.</p>
