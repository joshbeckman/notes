Man, I need more things in my life that are as beautifully-made and heart-healing as [LISTERS: A Glimpse Into Extreme Birdwatching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl-wAqplQAo). I laughed and reflected and was inspired. 

Things to remember:
- "nature" is everywhere, and you should recognize and treasure it everywhere, so that you learn to protect it and keep it everywhere.
- no fancy photography or artistry is required for a good video, but it helps
- you can just _start doing something_
- people are extremely weird

The fact that Owen just threw this up on YouTube with no ads for the world to watch just _fits_.
