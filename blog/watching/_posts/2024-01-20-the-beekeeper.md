I had initially seen the preview for this movie while waiting for [*Godzilla Minus One*](/movies/watching-godzilla-1-with-brandon-and-matt) to start and I laughed out loud\. I thought it was a parody movie \- pulling every single action movie / Jason Statham trope into a single plot and cranking them up to 11\. I jokingly said that we had to go see it for a fun time\.

Smash cut to us sitting in the theater tonight, cackling and yelling at the screen during what was honestly the most fun action movie I may have ever seen\. The plot was primitive\. The dialogue was almost entirely one\-liners and sometimes incoherent from moment to moment\. Some of the characters \(the buddy cops\) felt entirely improvised, full of non\-sequiturs and repeated lines\. So many characters had over\-the\-top accents and comical attributes \(like a gang of half\-drunk assassins\)\.

It felt like watching an action movie that had been transformed into a comic and then transformed again into a live\-action display and it pummeled me into enjoyment\.
