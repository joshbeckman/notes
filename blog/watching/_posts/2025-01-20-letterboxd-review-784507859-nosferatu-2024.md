She stays in shadow as he climbs the stairs toward the light. He smiles and says something like, "In heathen times, you would have been a priestess of Isis." I wanted to see more of *that* movie.</p><p>There's a scene where Ellen is possessed, writhing in front of her lover, every contortion tying another knot in his mind as he flails at what to do. And she slowly turns up her face to reveal something almost inhuman. I wanted to see more of that movie.</p>
