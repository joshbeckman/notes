I was out of breath - or holding bated breath - with the characters multiple times, and the handheld camera really pulled me into the frame. </p><p>I loved this so much more than <a href="https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/letterboxd-review-1124142364-the-taking-of-pelham-one-two-three" rel="nofollow">The Taking of Pelham 123</a> as a dirty portrait of dirty New York transportation and crime. It’s just so much smarter and suspenseful and the ending is utterly, sickeningly perfect. </p><p><a href="https://letterboxd.com/neditor/film/the-french-connection/" rel="nofollow">Ned, you were right</a> about this one.</p>
