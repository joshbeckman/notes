That brought in a few horror-movie non-fans that yelled and jumped at all the scares and made it so much fun.</p><p>Such a great mix of sci-fi and mystery and comedy and gore; it's so cool to see the inspiration for fun like <a href="https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/reanimator" rel="nofollow"><em>Re-Animator</em></a> and <em>The X-Files</em>.</p><p>I guess Keith David's voice has always been gold.</p><p>(For <em>once</em> I'm glad I don't speak Norwegian; apparently the guy in the beginning spoils a lot of it if you can understand him.)</p>
