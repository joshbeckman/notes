This was my first time seeing a movie at the Alamo Drafthouse and it was pretty good\! The trivia before the show \(special to the movie\) was fun\. Though, I did order a beer twice and it never came until the third attempt at writing it down \(along with a longer message\) for the server\. And the screen is a bit smaller than a normal movie theater \- or maybe it’s just because you can’t sit as close to it?

I went into the movie with a bit of a prejudice against it from [an article I read](https://www.vulture.com/article/renaissance-a-film-by-beyonce-review.html?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email#) about how Beyonce basically stands for no political position\. And how powerful of a force she could be for a cause she wanted to affect\.

But I liked the movie anyway\. The dancers \(Amari\!\) were my favorite part\.
