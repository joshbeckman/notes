Nick took me to go see this at a matinee 70mm showing by the Music Box Theater. It was pretty, and entrancing, and left me torn and questioning who was the _actual_ master and who did I actually want to know and what was _actually_ driving most of the characters.

I think it, like other Paul Thomas Anderson movies I've seen, left me trying to pick up pieces of story to assemble a single narrative when really the narrative is that lives are complex and broken and sparkle at times and we should appreciate them in ugliness and entangled repair.
