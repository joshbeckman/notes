I feel like that's relevant somehow.</p><p>I laughed *a lot* during the hunt sequence and I appreciate that the ending was a re-centering on her main problem, but I feel like the whole narrative could have been done with a bit more of *her* perspective rather than those around her.</p><p>Boy do I wish I could pull off a Long Island accent.</p>
