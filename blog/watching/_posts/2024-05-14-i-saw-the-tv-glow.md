I watched this director's earlier film, _We're All Going to the World's Fair_, on my own years ago. I knew what to expect: something patient and ethereal, with some unsettling bits that leach into your mind.

I was hoping this one would be a bit more aggressive/scary, but instead I kind of felt let down. I think that was kind of the point, but that didn't make me like it.
