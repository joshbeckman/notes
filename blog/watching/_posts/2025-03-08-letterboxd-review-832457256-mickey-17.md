The director made a lot of decisions, but it felt like every one was made independently and many in a different direction. </p><p>It's sci-fi, so of course I'm going to appreciate the world-building bits, but I left feeling a bit queasy and without a specific decision with which to name the queasiness. Maybe it was all of them put together that did it.</p>
