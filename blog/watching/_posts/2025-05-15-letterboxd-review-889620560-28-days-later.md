The photography was so consistently using those two devices that it felt like a constant signature.</p><p>Thanks to my friend Ned: we hauled out his old 30" CRT screen TV (all 163lbs of it) and Playstation 3 to watch the DVD and it felt gloriously like watching it in someones basement in the 2000s.</p>
