It is incredibly and deceptively engaging to watch the main character make wrong turn after surprisingly wrong turn, even while his moxie convinces you he's know what he's doing and tricks you into thinking he's on the right path. It's like listening to music where every expected chord resolution is skipped and you reach for it on the next beat. (And the soundtrack!)</p>
 
Like [Ned said: this is the peak of Hollywood](https://letterboxd.com/neditor/film/chinatown/). I kept wondering to myself, "Is this where the tropes *got started* or did all the tropes *culminate* in this film?"

We watched this as part of *Bleak Week* at the Music Box and, boy, that ending sneaks up and slits your throat.
