That's why this movie is so good. Everything falls apart and pieces are grotesquely reassembled like the patterns of divorce.</p><p>The script is incoherent at times but littered with gut-punching accuracy:</p><blockquote><p>I can't exist by myself because I'm afraid of myself, because I'm the maker of my own evil.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Nobody taught me that. That's why I'm with you. Because you say "I" for me.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I met a man who loved everything, and he died in a flood of shit.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You know what this is for? All the lies! [slaps]<br />Then you would have to add more.</p></blockquote><p>That scene had me shuddering. The whole thing had me shuddering.</p>
