Almost every heightened scene was brought to a simpering halt by terrible, floppy attempted-one-liners said by a character with flat affect and no reason to talk. </p><p>For a film that’s so visually invested, why not <i>show</i> a character’s emotion, rather than having it forced half/heartedly into cliche words?</p><p>We saw this in 3D IMAX and as we walked in the guy handed us the wrong glasses so had to get them swapped as the movie started. People right on top of their game. </p><p>Yes, it’s very pretty at times.</p>
