And I remembered it for teaching me slapstick comedy and that adults are children and that Jonathan Winters can make me feel any emotion by contorting his face.</p><p>Watching it for the first time in a long time, on a gorgeous 70mm Panavision scale, I was struck by the burning golden beauty of Southern California and the effortless complement that all these comedy greats made to each other on screen and how much the writers hated women. There's always too much going on in the plot but just enough in the scene and I still love it.</p>
