Brandon and Matt came over for scary movie night\. I was inspired by the spring sunshine and so I bought a mango and made a puree and then mixed it with some mezcal and citrus and orgeat and creme de banane and it was tasty along with our Thai food for dinner\. In contrast to the sweet drink, I was craving “a gritty horror movie” and we landed on ​*Saint Maud*​\.

The movie was brooding, and I turned up the sound so that the deep pulling bass rattled the bottles in the cabinet\. Unsettling distorted faces only get you so far, and when the story and turn of the knife really kicked into a pleasantly high gear it was already over\. I liked it, but wanted more \- just like Maud wanted more\.
