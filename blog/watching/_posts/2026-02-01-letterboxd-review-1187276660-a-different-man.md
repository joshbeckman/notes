But <em>A Different Man</em> is like the folk-rock version of <em>The Substance</em>'s electro-punk tune.</p><p>To me, these films ask, "Do you have to get the fix you want to discover your real problem?" So often I think I know what I need, only to find it brings me no cure. </p><p>The beginning is a bit slow but this film continuously turns up the speed and surprise and twists the screw tighter as it winds up, culminating in a stab-you-in-the-heart climax - and <em>also</em> a great final line - that will stick with me for a while.</p><blockquote><p>You haven't changed a bit.</p></blockquote>
