Because 2025 is over, I just got my [2025 Letterboxd Summary of movies](https://letterboxd.com/joshbeckman/year/2025/summary/). This was the first year I reviewed every new movie I saw, using the Letterboxd platform (and [pulling the reviews into my site via PESOS](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/crossposting-from-letterboxd-to-jekyll)), so I think this is actually a complete picture of *new* movies from my year.

> [!NOTE]
> I think in 2026 I'll actually try to log movie re-watches on Letterboxd as well. I'm interested in knowing how many times I've watched certain films and interested in getting a more complete picture of my movie-watching habits, beyond just the new consumption.

I don't believe in just leaving a rating on a new movie, so I wrote at least a bit of a review for each one. Usually I wait until the morning after, to let my thoughts coalesce and hopefully find something worthwhile to say in my review. I think the act of composing a review that you think is worth reading is a good exercise and has helped me improve my writing and thinking about art and story. I heartily recommend it.

## By the Numbers

I watched and reviewed 59 new films, filling about ~121 hours of watching time.

The most I ever watched in one week was 6 films, on May 12-18.

My most-watched genre was [horror, the undead and monster classics](https://letterboxd.com/joshbeckman/diary/for/2025/theme/horror-the-undead-and-monster-classics/by/date/?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=yir&utm_source=theme&utm_content=yir). Thanks to Matt and Brandon.

Apparently my most-watched director was [Josh Safdie](https://letterboxd.com/joshbeckman/diary/for/2025/with/director/josh-safdie/by/date/?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=yir&utm_source=contributor-name&utm_content=yir), but that was only two films. What's funny is that they were my first and last films of the year! And both were films I loved!

## Top Films

Maybe I'm too generous with my ratings. Or maybe I just choose good movies to watch. But I had a lot of high ratings.

My highest-rated (5 stars) films of the year were:
- [Weapons](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/letterboxd-review-976481187-weapons-2025)
- [One Battle After Another](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/letterboxd-review-1030754741-one-battle-after-another)
- [Marty Supreme](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/letterboxd-review-1132578619-marty-supreme)
- [Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/letterboxd-review-1096348048-kill-bill-the-whole-bloody-affair)
- [Possession](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/letterboxd-review-1093959706-possession)
- [The Thing](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/letterboxd-review-1039608007-the-thing)
- [Sorcerer](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/letterboxd-review-1006297102-sorcerer)
- [Citizen Kane](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/letterboxd-review-1002818668-citizen-kane)
- [Mulholland Drive](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/letterboxd-review-991467845-mulholland-drive)
- [Grave of the Fireflies](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/letterboxd-review-931543129-grave-of-the-fireflies)
- [Chinatown](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/letterboxd-review-906334089-chinatown)
- [Stop Making Sense](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/letterboxd-review-836663704-stop-making-sense)
- [No Country for Old Men](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/letterboxd-review-823846485-no-country-for-old-men)
- [Jurassic Park](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/letterboxd-review-821746560-jurassic-park)
- [The Apartment](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/letterboxd-review-812216644-the-apartment)
- [House](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/letterboxd-review-803604126-house)

That's 16/56 films! 29% of the time I give a movie 5 stars?! Ok, yeah, maybe I'm too generous. I'll have to think about whether/how I want to change that in 2026.
