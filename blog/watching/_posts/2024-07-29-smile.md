When I watched the previews for this film a couple years ago, I thought it was going to be too cheesy and filled with cheap scares. After I was recommended it at a party, I watched: I was wrong.

It reminded me of _The Babadook_ and _[Godzilla Minus One](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/watching-godzilla-1-with-brandon-and-matt)_ and _Hereditary_ as a movie that displays trauma as a horror for the characters to fight. And that extra level elevates it.
