And I gave another star just for M. Emmet Walsh's performance.</p><p>You can see so much of what a Cohen style would become: mirrored cinematic transitions, sweaty realism, stupidly and misunderstanding as fatal flaw, patient conversations, heavy diegetic sound. This first attempt just isn't as refined as they would become.</p>
