I wanted to have a scary movie night with Matt and Brandon and they noticed that Regal theaters in Chicago is doing mystery movie Mondays\. You buy a $5 ticket to a 7pm showing of a revealed upcoming release\. 

For tonightâ€™s, they had to disclaim that it was rated R and a horror movie so we knew it would fit the bill\. 

Sting was enjoyable but kept calling me back to other movies\. It had some emotional grounding for every character, like The Babadook\. It had the monster in the walls like Agua Mala from X\-Files\. It had the premonition aspects of Unbreakable\. It had the teen angst of Talk To Me\. But, mashed together, I liked it\. I laughed out loud at some moments, like the reference to Lord of The Rings and the exterminator, and there was dialogue that was brutally expository of emotion, but I laughed and loved within its web\.
