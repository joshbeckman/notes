We watched the second installment with Nick and Stephanie and we all talked for hours afterward about the movie\. It’s what great sci\-fi should do\. It’s not the *best* I’ve ever seen, but I really enjoyed this one\. I enjoyed it more than the first; more always happens in the second episode\.

I absolutely *loved* the theme of ‘engineered religion’ in this movie\. The revelations behind the curtain of how belief was manufactured, and then seeing the belief validated, and the audience not knowing which is the truth was delightful\. Has me hoping for more in the next movie\.

Here are some thoughts I wrote down right after the movie ended, to puzzle over in the future:
- How might someone walk through the urban environment as gracefully as they do in this idealized/romanticized sandscape?
- Dream bigger\. People are only inspired by big dreams\. If you have to take a shot, make it a big one and do it honestly and people will respond\.
- Video and audio and transcript: We have the modern technology to make it happen like the royalty in this movie, but why am I not using it every day?
- Figure out how the pressure points on a person and you can get anything done\.
