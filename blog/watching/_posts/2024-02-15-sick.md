Scary movie night with Matt and Brandon and we watched _Sick_\. 

It was *fine* and all\. We were bugged because it is set in April 2020 and we kept spotting things that were not of that date\. Things like people having medical grade masks available and using drugstore testing kits and such\. Just set it a few months later\! We were there and we know what it was like\. 

It had some fun slasher moments but nothing unique enough for me to come back to this one\.
