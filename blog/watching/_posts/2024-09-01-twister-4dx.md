I've seen this movie so many times growing up, but I'm counting it as "new" this time because we went to see it [in 4DX](https://www.regmovies.com/4dx).

To have your seat jerk as someone takes a punch is delightful. To have your body rumble when an actor slaps the hood of a car is hilarious. And to bo tossed around in wind and light water spray during a tornado scene as Stephanie cries out next to you, "Did we sign a waiver for this?!" is amazingly fun.
