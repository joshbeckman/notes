We went to go see this film with Ned and Jet as part of Gialo January at The Music Box\. 

It was fantastic\. A campy whodunnit in Italian\. Find a way to watch it\.

We were lucky: the movie had *never* before been shown in theaters \- initially released on television in 1978, then straight to VHS \- so we were the first people *ever* to see it on the big screen\.
