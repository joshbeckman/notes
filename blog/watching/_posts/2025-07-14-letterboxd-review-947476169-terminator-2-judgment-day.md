I guess this is the blockbuster that puts all the other blockbusters to shame.</p><p>Major props to the director for actually trying to scare people away from nuclear war. What a great mix of special and practical effects.</p><p>Speaking of which, I *laughed out loud* at: "You think it's the Russians? But aren't we friends now?" I remember hearing basically the same line in *Sneakers* and nothing stamps an early '90s movie quite like that.</p>
