The format is just perfect for unfolding a story with fast comedy timing.</p><p>I wasn't surprised by the great comedy (it was there!) but was surprised by the emotional acting - especially from the janitor and the maid. I loved it. And the detective was well done - it could have grown gating after long, but the actor kept it light and fresh.</p><p>I would have loved this more if they had a memorable score and if they had tightened up the runtime a bit (I think they could have cut 75% of the hearing sub-plot).</p>
