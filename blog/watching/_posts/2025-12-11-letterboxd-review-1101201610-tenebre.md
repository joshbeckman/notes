It’s crazy how directly the samples were lifted from this score, and damn do they feel right in these scenes. </p><p>Secondly, the crescendo ending, while soiled by our streaming platform with an ad, is exciting and perfectly assembled. </p><p>Thirdly, this movie contains what must be the longest tracking shot of random brutalist architecture set to tense music for no good reason and that’s just fun.</p>
