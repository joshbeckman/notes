The movie is not good. We know it's not going to be good. But we know it will be fun. The moralizing is heavy-handed, but not wrong, and yet it is forgotten halfway through. And there are great shots cutting to terrible angles. And the science is laughable - if you can even call it an attempt at science - and the caricatured mayor is a delight and it all falls apart.
