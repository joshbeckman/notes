Brandon and Matt and I had our regular scary movie night at Matt’s place this week\!

Usually we hem and haw for a while about what movie we should watch, but Matt had one queued up for us: *The Devils* was available on The Criterion Channel\.

This movie wasn’t *scary* \- it made you feel repulsed by humanity \- but it was *good* and engrossing\. As soon as it ended, I said “This felt like a play, not a movie,” because there were so many well\-developed \(and well\-acted\) characters\. Everyone had a back story and well\-understood motivations\. It played with my emotions, too: the main character was despicable in the beginning and won my support by the end\.

My only problems were that some aspects felt disjointed: there was a middle section that felt out of place with the rest of the story \(a character takes a strange ethereal horse ride for a while\) and some comic relief characters felt grotesque in contrast to some of the horrific scenes\. And I guess I felt they put *too much* in the story: it’s based on true events, but not all needed to be in the film\.

Recommended if you like the idea of a religious history horror film\.
