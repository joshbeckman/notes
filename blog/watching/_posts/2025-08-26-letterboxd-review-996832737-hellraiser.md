I did not expect "come to daddy" to be the most-repeated line in this movie, and that felt out of place! Maybe people said that a lot in the '80s and I just never knew?</p><p>I think the best parts of this film are the practical effects. The sequence of him raising from Hell was well worth the price of admission.</p><p>Afterward, we pulled up the trailer for the 2022 remake of Hellraiser and boy did that look different. The original wastes no time on backstory or "how the box works" or anything, while, even in just the preview, the 2020s version has a whole research montage about reading books to explain exactly how it works. Yuck.</p>
