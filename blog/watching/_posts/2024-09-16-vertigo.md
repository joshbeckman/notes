I thought this movie was about people being afraid of heights.

And it kind of is, but mostly it made me think about the subtle and not-so-subtle horrors that people can do to each other. The rhythmic and ethereal scenes and music really did move me into the movie screen, but the characters more than the cinematography made me slowly sick to my stomach.

James Stewart really can deliver his lines like a real-life conversation and that's always fun to watch. Throughout, I also thought: I want to see a cut of this movie from Midge's perspective. She's the coolest!

We got to see this in a beautiful 70mm restoration at the Music Box Theater, along with a bunch of people from Marybeth's comedy troupe, Hitch*Cocktails.
