This film does an amazing job at retaining doubt throughout an evolving plot, after the fall in the second scene. It's hard to keep the audience balanced for so long, and it felt unsettling to be kept perched that way.

There was so much tension in every mundane scene: the romantic tension between the adults, the tension of the boy's internal turmoil, life and death scares, on and on. That's the sign of a well-made idea.
