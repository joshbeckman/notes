This was a great horror-movie plus playing-game-levels-adventure plus uncomfortably-sexual-alien-monster played out in space. I kinda wanted a better/scarier look for the final... thing, but the pacing kept me pulled in the whole time. I think I enjoyed the "android _Flowers For Algernon_" more than most - I've got a lot of that similar thinking on my mind lately.

I love the original _Alien_ and this, of course, made me want to watch it again and appreciate it more. I love the "space junkers" aesthetic so much more than the modern "smooth steel" sci-fi look. Watching this made me want to put cargo pockets on all my jackets.
