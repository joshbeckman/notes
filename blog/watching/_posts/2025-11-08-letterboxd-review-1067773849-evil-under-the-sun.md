She had many differences between the book and the movie to point out, but we still enjoyed it quite a bit.</p><p>There was a bit too much reveal in the final summation for me to love it as a clever murder mystery, but I really loved Peter Ustinov's portrayal of Poirot: comedic and pretentious with great bits of physical comedy. The Cole Porter music was also dandy.</p><p>I really want to go hiking and swimming on that island.</p>
