In this case, music vs. religion as communal spirit, explored through a gory thriller genre.</p><p>My favorite anchor was the doorway. The permission to enter is a throwaway in so many other vampire movies but here holds the weight of so many conversations and temptations and character development that it felt stronger than many other "rule" in other movies.</p><p>I really enjoyed the ending recitation between the good and evil leads, the joining of the two voices, the betrayal of the assumed savior, the upright justification. I wished the movie could have stayed there longer, to make Sam's reach for the guitar that much more cathartic.</p>
