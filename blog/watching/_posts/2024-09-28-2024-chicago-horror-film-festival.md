Matt and Brandon and I had a lovely evening of horror short (and a couple feature-length!) films at the Logan Square Theater on the first night of [their annual horror film fest](https://chicagohorrorfilmfest.ticketspice.com/chicago-horror-film-festival).

We got to watch:

## Party Panda: The Birth of A Serial Killer

I laughed a lot at this but I'm unsure if we were supposed to? It was a vehicle for the main actor to do what he wanted.

## Teacups and Cookies

It telegraphed the twist a bit much for me, but not bad overall.

## The Earth, The Worm

Creepy ethereal - could do with some tightening up.

## The Secret Other

Yikes. Bad sound. Bad writing.

## Tinkerhell

Wonderfully put together. Tightly wound and fun.

## Chute

The sound was broken for this so I dunno - looked ok?

## Jade

Really fun - sexy horror.

## Clawface

We laughed so hard that sometimes I forgot it was a horror movie, but it came back to that theme every once in a while. Nothing especially unique except that the off-kilter comedy kept me glancing around as every scene lasted a few seconds too long and it made me laugh.

## Black Spines

This had some good cinematography and acting but I got bored by the slow pacing.
