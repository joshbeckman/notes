I watched this under its English name: *The Wolf House*.

I'll have trouble describing this movie, but I'll tell you this: it's mesmerizing. And unsettling. And disjointed. And wild. And touching. And made me marvel at what humans can create.

If you don't understand both Spanish and German (like me) and have to watch it with subtitles: *pay attention* to when they speak in one language or another (and _who_ is speaking).
