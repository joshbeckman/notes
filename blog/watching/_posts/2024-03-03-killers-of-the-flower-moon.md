Started this too late in the night \(itâ€™s *soo* long\) but I enjoyed the film\. Scorsese is a master film maker\.

The story resonated with me as a more serious complement to [Braiding Sweetgrass](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/reading/braiding-sweetgrass) \- genocide of a native culture by methodical decisions by the machine of American culture\.
