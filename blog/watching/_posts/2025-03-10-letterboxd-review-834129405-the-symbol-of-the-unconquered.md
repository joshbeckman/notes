The jazz music was a huge highlight, especially when the KKK rode at night and they transitioned to spacey spooky synths. </p><p>There was a lot going on. For too many characters. And even though the theater’s opening presentation warned me, it was jarring to catch up as b-plot characters were introduced with long indistinguishable flashbacks. But it’s definitely darkly funny as a response to Birth of A Nation. </p><p>I kept wondering how anyone built a fence when it took them two minutes on screen to dig a hole six inches deep.</p>
