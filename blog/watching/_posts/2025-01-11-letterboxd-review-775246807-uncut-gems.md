It was a layover that originally was planned to be 3 hours but then chance and LA wildfires turned that into 55 minutes. We had to disembark the first plane, go through US Customs, pick up our checked bags, drop them at a different carrier, leave the airport, run nearly a mile to another terminal, go through TSA security, get randomly checked, and run to the gate of the departing flight. </p><p>There was lots of sweating, bumps, and bruises. And no one in our group of four thought we would make it before takeoff. But we bet big and it paid off.</p><p>So I decided to ride the adrenaline and watch this in my seat.</p>
