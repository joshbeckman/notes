And the ending: while I appreciate the footage, it was jarring incongruous and ultimately distracted from the rest.</p><p>I waffled on whether I actually liked the film, but I’ve been thinking about its topics and characters for so long afterward that it’s earned a high rating just for mindshare and inspiring my interest. </p><p>My favorite part/character is Italian Mable Guy. Gorgeous, captivating, talented: “I went to beat Mussolini’s corpse with my own hands.” I want to be him. I want to go to there.</p>
