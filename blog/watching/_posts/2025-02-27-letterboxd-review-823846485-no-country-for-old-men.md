The sun and sound and straight pace let the whole story reinforce the villain's inevitable footsteps of doom. And every time, as I get older between each viewing, I identify more and more with the sheriff's sigh and stare and steadfast pursuit.</p><p>It's a film that actually feels how I feel when I walk and hunt in the Texas scrub. You stare for miles and the night is cold and the day is hot and nothing cares for you and everything just leads on to the horizon.</p>
