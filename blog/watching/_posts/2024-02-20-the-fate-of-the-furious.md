We watched this “helluva ride” “sum b\*\*ch” movie with Nick and Stephanie and Maddie after the long weekend and it was an unbelievable romp\.

I know Nick told me, when we started watching these Fast and Furious movies, that eventually they would be superheroes saving the world, but ​*damn*​\. This one has them disarming nukes and surviving explosions that destroy a submarine and nobody’s skin is even scraped and it’s a cackling good time\.

Nick does the *best* Jason Statham accent\.
