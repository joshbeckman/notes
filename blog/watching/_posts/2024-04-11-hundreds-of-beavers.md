Rob invited us to this movie and we went in knowing nothing\.

I met Bill for a drink down at Code di Volpe beforehand and then we walked up to the Music Box and the line to get in was already the length of the block\. For people with tickets already\! It was sold out\. There was someone dressed in a beaver mascot costume running up and down the line giving high fives\. We got in and James and Heather were already there as well\.

The organist was playing as people filed in\. After a while, the theater manager came up on stage and said “I was told to read this card aloud\.” And the card gave some disclaimers about the film, and then the manager invited up one of the producers, and this producer mounted the stage wearing a giant rabbit mascot head\. He had to stuff the microphone under the helmet/head to use it while he raffled off some branded hats while making jokes about Wisconsin\. As he was finishing the raffle, the beaver mascot was crawling and hiding throughout the seated crowd\. Eventually, the rabbit called out to the beaver and brought them on stage and as the curtain rose they fought in stage combat and as the movie flickered to life on the screen the rabbit ripped off the beaver’s head in a killing blow\.

Yeah, it was that kind of movie\. Indelible\.
