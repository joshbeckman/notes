This was made in '48, and Nietzsche was top of mind for everyone (it's even mentioned in the script), so I guess that tracks. But I think a modern adaptation of this film/play would have Brandon be rich or a celebrity, and have <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/23/464129029/donald-trump-i-could-shoot-somebody-and-i-wouldnt-lose-any-voters" rel="nofollow">his righteousness</a> stem from there.</p><p>Also: Poor Phillip – he just wanted to have a gay holiday with his boyfriend.</p>
