With Matt and Brandon over for scary movie night, I wanted ‘a good scary movie’ after the bad taste of [Sick](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/watching/sick) in my mouth\. So we selected this cult classic from the ‘80s\. 

And, boy, was it ‘80s\. Campy and not *that* scary but a well\-told interesting story with [unfortunate] gratuitous male gaze throughout\. The lead actor was delightful to watch.
