But this felt more like an adult's movie - something made by talented artists exercising the craft of Looney Tunes animation. </p><p>It's the classic animation style with great gags and grand color. I'd say the only parts that dragged for me were the points of heavy plot development - light with jokes - that doesn't *quite* make sense and is kinda not the point.</p><p>I absolutely love seeing "early sketches" in the credits of animated movies - especially noticing how they're different from the end result. Please do this for all movies.</p>
