John wanted to go to Mammoth Cave for the long weekend and I hadn't been since I was a kid so I was happy to join. The drive was terrible because my car broke down in Indianapolis but we persevered and the rainy weather was perfect for hiking underground through miles and miles of the biggest cave system in the world.

We took a tour with only lantern light - to emulate how the caves were originally explored - and it was well worth the extra effort.

## Nashville

We drove up to Nashville for an evening and loved what we found. The bartenders at [Coral Club](https://www.thecoral.club/) were so friendly and the food at [Audrey](https://www.audreynashville.com/menus/) was delicious.
