This was our second time in Denver, but the first time actually spending time in the city. We flew in for a quick weekend to watch [Big Wild play at Red Rocks](/blog/attending/big-wild-at-red-rocks).

The city itself is so quiet. The sky was bright and hot and beautiful every day, and the streets are very walkable. We walked to dinner and then to a fancy bar with a wait and then a crowded artsy bar with no wait and then back to _Death & Co._ for fancy cocktails. We got to watch a drone show amidst fireworks over the baseball stadium and it was mesmerizing. The people were nice - we had many impromptu chats and took their recommendations.

## Recommendations

We found great coffee at _Fluid_. We ate fantastic food and met great service at _Gaia Masala and Burger_.
