After reading about the old version of the US Open [from David Foster Wallace](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/reading/string-theory-by-david-foster-wallace) (on my way to stumbling into a tournament [in New Zealand](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/traveling/auckland-new-zealand)) I was excited to go see the big modern cultural and competitive event in person. Ned had been before, so he organized the tickets and got us good seats for the third round on Saturday night and Sunday night of the long Labor Day weekend.

The Saturday night session was great - the whole experience was new for me. Watching Bublik smash a serve at 135mph and then gently drop-shot barely over the next to make Tommy Paul scramble was utterly amazing. They were the last match: went into three tie-breaker sets and lasted until nearly 2AM. Ned and I stumbled home on the subway because we had left home before 5AM and [run Prospect Park in the afternoon](https://www.joshbeckman.org/exercise/15640542790).

Sunday morning we woke up and ran [over 10 miles in Prospect Park again](https://www.joshbeckman.org/exercise/15649814478) before enjoying the Mets game across the street from the Arthur Ashe tennis stadium and then going in for the Sunday night matches. I think the US Open is the closest I've come to something like the Kentucky Derby: a sporting event with such a high ratio of "people wanting to be seen" to people wanting to see the event. Walking from the Mets, through Flushing, back into the beauty of tennis culture was quite jarring. But NYC makes it all feel of a place.

The Sunday night session was even more packed because Novak Djokovic was handily beating his opponent. The best match we saw that night was Rybakina against Vondrasouva. Our seats were a little further back but still we could see how they were trying to overpower each other.

Monday morning we woke up to [run a farewell in Prospect Park](https://www.joshbeckman.org/exercise/15659344389) and then explored Brooklyn by foot until our evening flight. My legs were sore from joining on all of Ned's marathon training.

## Video

I'm trying to take more and trying to get better at editing video. Editing video is teaching me how I need to be shooting video. I'm trying to edit and publish quickly, to get more reps in. Here's a vignette of the weekend:
