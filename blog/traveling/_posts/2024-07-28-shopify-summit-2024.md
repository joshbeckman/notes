I spent the week in Toronto's Enercare Center, talking to hundreds of the thousands of people there with me.

A day of company strategy, [a night of concerts](/blog/attending/the-roots-weezer-girl-talk-at-budweiser-stage). A day talking to developers/customers, a night walking home through the streets of Toronto. A day of hacking on prototypes, a night of games. A day of hacking on more prototypes, a night of partying. A final day of hacking, a night of travel.

It was exhausting and invigorating and impressive. Shopify can do great things.
