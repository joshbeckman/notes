Shopify's annual company-wide summit was amazingly fun and productive, again ([previously](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/traveling/shopify-summit-2024)). Again, the company rented out the entire Enercare Center on Toronto's waterfront. It's an amazing takeover of a huge space, filling it with a gigantic hackathon and party.

I spent a day in 1:1s and management/alignment/politics/trust-building and a day hacking on several prototypes (half of which I'll end up shipping) and a day leading a masterclass and booth at Shopify's Editions.dev conference.

[Here's a view of my main desk for the week](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/working/desk-may-30th-2025), though I floated around and walked like 8 miles each day (between walking to to Enercare and walking to find people/things inside Enercare).

It was - again - exhausting and invigorating and impressive. I still think Shopify can do great things and I'm so happy to be building faster and better with these great people.
