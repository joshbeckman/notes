I've been listening to Mustard Service's _Variety Pack_ album since I [saw them last year](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/attending/bombay-bicycle-club-and-mustard-series-at-metro). This newest album from them has an even greater range - from the driving _Going Nowhere_ to the dreamy and lilting _2 AM_ - and has been my go-to for relaxing in the hot summer breeze. The tunes are just so catchy and fit well with a cool drink in your hand.
