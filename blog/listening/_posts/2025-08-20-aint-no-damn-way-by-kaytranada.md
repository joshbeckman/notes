![AIN'T NO DAMN WAY! by KAYTRANADA](/assets/images/album_art/kaytranada-aintnodamnway.jpg)

This isn't full of bangers but it's full of bops that are _fantastic_ to listen to while working in the morning. Just lots of little loops that wiggle their way into my body and then I find my shoulders shimmying to the beat.
