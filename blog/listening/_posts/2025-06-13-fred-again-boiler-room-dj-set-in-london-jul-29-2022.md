It was mentioned recently in [an interview I was listening to](https://www.joshbeckman.org/exercise/14749929323), but it has to be said more widely: this DJ set is one of the bests, _ever_. I have listened to it _dozens_ of times, and the love and thunder of the crowd is great each time. And watching [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0-hvjV2A5Y) is so highly recommended: there's a moment where someone accidentally turns off the music and Fred brings it back in happily and the joy and forgiveness is perfect.
