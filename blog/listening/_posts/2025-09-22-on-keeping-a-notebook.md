This is my favorite essay on writing, by Joan Didion, read by Parker Posey.

I remember hearing this on NPR's "Selected Shorts" radio show years ago (for a "Writers on Writing" episode, I _think_ [in 2013](https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2013/september/creative-writing-programs-reading-series-to-feature-parker-posey-yusef-komunyakaa-and-jonathan-lethem-in-oct.html)), and I've probably listened to it dozens of times since then. I would listen to it so often, that I downloaded it to my iPod and stored it on an old laptop.

Recently, I wanted to listen once more, and I could not find it available anywhere online. So I ripped it from the old laptop, trimmed up the episode to just this reading, and am uploading it here for posterity.
