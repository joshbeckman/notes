I watched this set when it was first released but it came back to mind this morning because I heard a spoken word track and I remembered that the 50~55min section of this show is one of the best examples of an  intense emotional connection and incredible uplift at a concert. The whole set is pretty good, but that track's performance _must_ have been something special to feel in person.
