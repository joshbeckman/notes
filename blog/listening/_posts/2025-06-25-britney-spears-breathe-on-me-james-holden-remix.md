I don't know who else needs to hear this great remix today but I stumbled upon [this set by Jamie xx at _ARTE_ in Adidas Arena, Paris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0GpUQpMBZY) which lead me to _this_ fantastic [set by Four Tet for _ARTE_ at Sónar 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmC6KIwjgFY&t=649s) where he featured [this unreleased remix by James Holden of _Breathe on Me_ by Britney Spears](https://www.jamesholden.org/index.php?p=12989) that hooked me and I was able to hunt down and has been stuck in my head all evening:
