Man, this would be one of my deserted island albums.

I don't know how I found this when it was released in 2017 but it was truly a gift. Since then, I will forget about it for a while, remember it (like I did last night), rediscover it, and listen to it a few times and just smile with gratitude.

I remember asking my friend [Jane Kim](https://www.janeskim.com/), "what genre of music is this?" and she said "post-punk." Apple Music calls it "alternative rap." I'd label it "breezy."
