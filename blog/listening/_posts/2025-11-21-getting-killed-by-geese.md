Man, I did _not_ expect to like this album, but something... something about the raw riffs on this record reel me in over and over again. It's absolutely become my favorite album of this fall. The yells and yawps and plodding melodies just stick in my head like sweet sticky tack. There's nothing quite like walking down the street while the *Islands of Men* track propels your steps.

Then they came out with a *From The Basement* set yesterday that reminded me of why I love that concert format so much. Maybe _The Basement_ fits them so well because they sound like a punk-ish version of *Radiohead*, down there wailing around on the carpet.
