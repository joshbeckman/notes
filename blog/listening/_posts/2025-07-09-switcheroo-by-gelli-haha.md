This album is so far my favorite of the summer. It's irreverent (just what I need as a tonic as the American government tumbles into terrifyingly serious disarray), off-kilter (a song about peeing into a jar), and contains some lovely synth hooks that have put the songs on repeat in my head and kept me dancing as the hot days roll in.

The line on [Gelli's artist bio](https://gelli.world/gelli-haha) is perfect:

> Gelli Haha exists somewhere between Studio 54 and Area 51.
