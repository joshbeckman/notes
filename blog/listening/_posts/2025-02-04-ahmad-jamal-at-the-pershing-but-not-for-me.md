Someone at work yesterday asked for jazz album recommendations and immediately I had to send back a link to this one: possibly my favorite jazz recording. The liveliness and ease you can hear in each song is wonderful.

Poinciana is worth the price of admission, alone. Loping along, it always makes me bounce on my feet as I listen.
