It’s still strange to me that Spotify Wrapped and [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/profile/andjosh) Replay and others prompt me to view my “year's Worth of Listening” well before the year is done. But here are some highlights from this year’s data:
- ~46k minutes listening time (down ~19k min from last year)
- Top artist: [Four Tet](https://www.fourtet.net/) (same as last year)
  - 1218 artists in total
- Top album: *[Live from Lyon, France, Oct 2024, 2025: Fred again..., Floating Points, & Caribou](https://album.link/us/i/1850548266)* (DJ set)
- Top song: *[Climbing (Mixed)](https://song.link/https://music.apple.com/us/album/climbing-mixed/1777520428?i=1777520433)* by *Caribou*

> [!NOTE]
> You can check out [my 2024 Apple Music Replay](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/listening/apple-music-replay-2024) to compare. See my more up-to-date aggregate stats [on my listening page](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/listening/).

I think Apple Music "calculates" my top album a bit differently than I do on my own stats page. I'm pretty sure they calculate it just by total listening time, and I prefer to calculate it through "play count".

That DJ set that they say is my top album is something like 4 hours long. I think I've listened to it twice in total. So that add up to a lot of listening time. But I have other albums (e.g. my *favorite* of this year: [Switcheroo by Gelli Haha](https://www.joshbeckman.org/blog/listening/switcheroo-by-gelli-haha)) that I have listened to *more times* for *less total time*. I consider the number of times I've played an album to be a better indicator of my "favorite" or "top" than just total time spent on the speakers.

## Small Artists

Apparently I was one of the top 100 listeners of:
- [Mel Blue](https://www.melbluemusic.com/)

And one of the top 1000 listeners to:
- [Ela Minus](https://elaminus.com/)

## Overview

I’d stand by that listening: I recommend all that. I kinda wish I had listened to more albums and fewer DJ sets, but the platforms have been publishing more DJ sets. I'm a predictable person: I find a good DJ set, I listen to it a lot.

I wonder why my listening time dropped by ~33% this year... I *feel* like I listened to just as much. Maybe some data was lost or maybe I spent more time outside hiking and playing. I'll choose to believe it was the latter.
