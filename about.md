I'm currently working as a Senior Staff Engineer at [Shopify](https://shopify.com), building [a visual programming platform](https://www.shopify.com/flow) for merchants and improving [the interfaces for Shopify developers](https://shopify.dev/).
I live in Chicago and [Chicago](/tags#chicago) is a great place to live. I've been traveling and backpacking more frequently, exploring new places, and spending time cultivating my garden.

I'm an engineering leader specializing in complex systems design and delivery at scale. I cut my technical teeth in high-velocity startup environments. Now I lead multiple teams within Shopify's large engineering organization to deliver highly complex interfaces at scale and speed. I focus on being a technical expert who can advise teams and drive technical design decisions in complex systems. I'm particularly excited about integrating AI and LLMs into software development practices and building systems that make these technologies accessible to the public.

My email address is `josh@joshbeckman.org`. I strongly prefer email as a communication method, so email me if you have a comment about something I've written - or write a post on your own site. Or you can follow/message me on open social networks (see *Verification* below).

> Want help with something? Here are [ways I'm able to help](/blog/ways-im-available-to-help). Or, [book some time to chat](https://cal.com/joshbeckman).

You can read more [about this site](/about-this-site) or the [tools I use](/uses).

## Support

In addition to writing and sharing tools on this site, I maintain many open-source software projects. I welcome any issues or ideas you may open there and _especially_ any code you can contribute. Creating and _maintaining_ open-source software and open writing takes a lot of time and money, so fund my software maintenance and writing [via GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/joshbeckman).
