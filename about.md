I'm currently working as a Senior Staff Engineer at [Shopify](//shopify.com), building [a visual programming platform](https://www.shopify.com/flow) for merchants and improving the interfaces for Shopify developers.
I live in Chicago and [Chicago](/tags#chicago) is a great place to live.

I'm an experienced startup operator with a history of scaling tech and teams. I'm a self-taught software developer, (and tech lead, and manager, yadda yadda) with a much wider-ranging career and education before that. I strive to bring curiosity, encouragement, and first-principles thinking to the work I'm doing.

My email address is `josh@joshbeckman.org`. I strongly prefer email as a communication method, so email me if you have a comment about something I've written - or write a post on your own site.

## Support

I'm [@joshbeckman on Github](//github.com/joshbeckman), where I maintain open-source software projects. I welcome any issues or ideas you may open there and _especially_ any code you can contribute. Creating and _maintaining_ open-source software and open writing takes a lot of time and money, so fund my software maintenance and writing [via GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/joshbeckman).
