I'm an experienced startup operator with a history of scaling tech and teams. I'm a self-taught software developer, (and tech lead, and manager) with a much wider-ranging career and education before that. I strive to bring curiosity, encouragement, and first-principles thinking to the work I'm doing.

I'm currently building as a Senior Staff Developer at Shopify.

## About This Site

I [wrote up the process and theory behind this website](https://www.joshbeckman.org/opening-up-my-highlights-notes/), but basically it's an export and reformatting of my highlights and notes of my online (and some offline) reading ([script here](https://github.com/joshbeckman/notes/blob/master/utilities/import)).

I use it to jostle loose ideas when I'm researching a particular problem in software design or writing topic. I usually either ask it for a random note or search by keyword.

The site theme is forked from [Simply Jekyll](https://github.com/raghudotcc/simply-jekyll), with alternative styling taken from [Tufte.css](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/). The site fonts are [Libertinus](https://github.com/alerque/libertinus/).

- **Margin notes** (Changelog you see on the left is an example of this).

   - Bad link: [[Title of a page that doesn't exist]]
- Press `Shift + s` to trigger search

### Infrastructure

- The site lives on [[Github::https://github.com/joshbeckman/notes]] and is served using GitHub Pages.
- This website is statically generated using Jekyll from a set of Markdown files.
- Except lunrjs and katex, there are no third party libraries.
