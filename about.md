I'm currently working as a Senior Staff Engineer at [Shopify](//shopify.com), building [a visual programming platform](https://www.shopify.com/flow) for merchants and improving the interfaces for Shopify developers.
I live in Chicago and [Chicago](/tags#chicago) is a great place to live.

I'm an experienced startup operator with a history of scaling tech and teams. I'm a self-taught software developer, (and tech lead, and manager, yadda yadda) with a much wider-ranging career and education before that. I strive to bring curiosity, encouragement, and first-principles thinking to the work I'm doing.

My email address is `josh@joshbeckman.org`. I strongly prefer email as a communication method, so email me if you have a comment about something I've written - or write a post on your own site. Or you can follow/message me on open social networks (see *Verification* below).

> Want help with something? Here are [ways I'm able to help](/blog/ways-im-available-to-help). Or, [book some time to chat](https://fantastical.app/joshbeckman).

You can read more [about this site](/about-this-site) or the [tools I use](/uses).

## Support

In addition to writing and sharing tools on this site, I maintain many open-source software projects. I welcome any issues or ideas you may open there and _especially_ any code you can contribute. Creating and _maintaining_ open-source software and open writing takes a lot of time and money, so fund my software maintenance and writing [via GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/joshbeckman).
